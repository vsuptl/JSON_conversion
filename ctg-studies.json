                "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if patient's own Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGMs) worn in the non-ICU hospital setting have adequate accuracy for blood glucose monitoring when compared to point-of-care (POC) capillary glucose measurement, and to determine if alerts given by CGMs worn in the non-ICU hospital would prevent episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.",
                "detailedDescription": "All patients admitted to the hospital in inpatient or observation status and having a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGMs) attached will be screened and identified by providers and nurses. An order will be placed by providers to continue patient's home CGM use in the hospital. \"CGM patient agreement\" describing the hospital policy for use of CGMs will be provided to the patient for signature. Patients will be encouraged to continue to wear their CGMs in the hospital unless their presence interferes with patients' medical care. CGM presence will be recorded by nursing in patient chart under LDA (lines, drains, airway) section. Patients will be approached by the research staff and will be offered enrollment in the study. A research consent will be reviewed with patients and will be provided for signature. Patients will be asked to continue to use their home CGMs in the hospital. If CGM sensor will reach the end of life, patients have the option to place a new sensor and to follow manufacturer recommendations for calibration and setting. Patients are responsible to provide their own sensors, transmitters and readers during the hospitalization period. If it is determined that the current sensor will interfere with hospital medical and surgical care (MRI testing, procedure at the site), patients will be asked to remove the CGM sensor and transmitter. Patients will have the option to replace the sensor after the procedure if they so desire.\n\nPatients will continue to monitor their glucose level via CGM. For flash sensors, patients will be asked to scan their sensor at least every 8 and as needed. CGMs that require calibration will be calibrated by the patients using hospital glucometer readings. .\n\nPatients alerted by their CGM about low glucose levels or fast downward or upward trending will have to notify their nursing staff. A POC blood glucose check will be done by nursing staff to confirm the alert or the trend. Treatment decisions will be made based on POC readings.\n\nDuring hospitalization patients will continue to have their blood glucose checked with POC glucometers per hospital policy.\n\nTreatment of diabetes and the associated complications, dosing of insulin, change from PO to insulin treatment and back to PO medications during hospitalization or at discharge will be done by the admitting team with help from the inpatient Endocrinology Consultation Service.\n\nDecisions about insulin dosing or other diabetes treatments will be made based on hospital glucometer readings, and not based on CGM readings alone.\n\nPatients will be asked to give the research team \"provider access\" to their cloud CGM software, or to allow the team to download their CGM data prior to discharge if their reading devices do not automatically synchronize with the cloud software.\n\nCGM data will be compared with POC glucometer readings obtained in the hospital at approximately the same time. Different patient variables (demographics, comorbidities, labs and vitals, administered medications) will be collected from electronic health record and will be evaluated to determine if they interfere with CGM readings. The accuracy of CGM for glucose measurement in the hospital will be calculated."

                "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess whether the short-term use of professional continuous glucose monitoring (Pro-CGM) at the Parkland Diabetes Clinic in selected patients with poorly-controlled diabetes due to hyper- and/or hypoglycemia leads to improvements in patients' glycemic control within 3-6 months, subjective understanding of how food, activity, and medications affect blood sugar levels, and diabetes self-care practices. The study will be a prospective cohort study that assesses patients glycemic control and diabetes self-care practices before and 3-6 months after utilization of a Pro-CGM for 10 days. Glycemic control and diabetes self-care practices will be assessed based on hemoglobin A1c measurements and glucose data download from glucometer and Pro-CGM. A short survey will be administered at the end of the 10 days Pro-CGM use to assess whether the Pro-CGM use had a positive impact on patients' understanding of how different activities affect their blood sugar and diabetes self-care practices.\n\nParkland Diabetes Clinic serves an ethnically diverse, low socioeconomic patient population, the majority of whom do not have access to diabetes technology like continuous glucose monitoring. CGM measures sugar levels every 5 to 15 minutes and have been shown in clinical studies to improve glycemic control. Establishing a professional CGM program at the clinic will provide short-term access to this technology. One of the main reason for conducting this study is to determine if Pro-CGM would be a useful intervention to integrate into the clinic's routine practice in the future."

Healthcare providers still continue to face difficulties in delivering optimal care and education worldwide. Thus, continuing education is needed to improve Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of physicians.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a continuing education (CE) program on the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of primary health care physicians (HCPs) towards a high quality of diabetes care.\n\nDesign and Methods:\n\nThis is a quasi-experimental design composed of pre-test post-test uncontrolled experimental design. The study will include all PHC physicians registered in health sectors of Abha and Khamis Musheet cities, Aseer Region. The physicians will be invited to attend a CE program. All participants will fill out a questionnaire before and after the intervention. The change in knowledge and attitudes of the participants will be measured at the end of the program. After 4 months, the practice of physicians will be assessed through retrospective review of patient's files.\n\nImpact:\n\nEducation programs could positively influence the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of healthcare workers toward a high quality of diabetes care, which in turn plays a major role in improving clinical outcomes."

The module will incorporate effective behavioral economics (BE) principles to improve the degree to which care of older adults is compliant with Choosing Wisely guidelines; this generally involves less aggressive targets for HbA1c, and reductions of medications other than metformin.\n\nThe implementation of the module will ultimately be triggered by medication prescribing in EPIC. The BE principles include suggesting alternatives to medications, requiring justification, setting of appropriate default order sets, and incorporation of anchoring and checklists to guide behavior. The study will involve provider workflow analysis based on observation, module user testing, and live usability testing with direct observation and semi-structure interviews.",

A secondary aim will be to study the relation of change in bicycling to all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality.\n\nMETHODS Study design and setting The study is a nested cohort study in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. In EPIC, 29 centers in 10 western European countries have collected information on nutrition, lifestyle, anthropometrics and medical history from more than 521 000 study individuals participating in this prospective cohort study. Dietary, medical history and lifestyle were assessed by questionnaires. Blood samples from the participants were taken at the study centers. Baseline (first examination) information was collected 1992-2000 and second examination for exposure has since been obtained at least once in every cohort. Exposure data has subsequently, to the two examinations, been linked to information on vital status and on cause of death were obtained through record linkages with national, regional or local registers, regional health departments, physicians or hospitals, active follow-up or health insurance.\n\nStudy population This nested prospective cohort study, sampled individuals with prevalent diabetes in the EPIC cohorts at the baseline assessments in the years 1992-2000. Self-reported and confirmed diabetes (validated by a second source (at least 1), including repeated self-report, contact with physician, linkage to register later point, intake of diabetes medicine, registration of diabetic chiropody, baseline glycated hemoglobin\\>=6.0%, five annual blood glucose measurements or two blood glucose measurements per year for five consecutive years) cases were included in the analyses. No information is available to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes across the population but type 1 is rare by comparison. The nested cohort for this study comprised 12,848 individuals with self-reported and/or confirmed diabetes. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 14.6 (4.8) years. Among the 12,848 prevalent diabetes cases, 5,809 cases were confirmed at baseline as described above.\n\nFor further detail, please see the predefined statistical analysis plan (SAP).

                "briefSummary": "A pilot study using the FreeStyle Libre to assess its potential benefits in patients with diabetes starting when they are inpatients and continuing during the transition of care to the outpatient setting to see if diabetes care can be improved after discharge.\n\nThis study is designed to address the following questions:\n\n1. How do the glucose readings from FreeStyle Libre Pro compare to our inpatient glucometer system? Is the system is accurate enough to use for clinical decision making?\n2. How often does the additional continuous glucose data change inpatient care?\n3. Does this technology work with inpatient nursing workflow?\n4. Does leaving the patch on at discharge and reading in the office improve transition of care?\n5. Does reading the patch after discharge in the office improve follow-up care?",
                "detailedDescription": "Continuous glucose monitoring checks blood glucose continuously. This allows the patient and provider to see what the glucose does between finger stick measurements. The FreeStyle Libre, is a sensor patch that can continuously measure glucose for up to two weeks.\n\nObjectives To see if new continuous glucose technology can 1) Improve glucose management in the hospital compared to finger sticks 4-5 times per day. 2) Help with glucose control during transition of care from hospital to home and follow-up in the office The main hypothesis of this study is if the additional glucose information improves diabetes care for patients in the hospital and after the transition to home.\n\nBackground The FreeStyle Libre Pro was recently approved by the FDA. It is a patch applied to the skin with glucose containing sensing technology that will record the subcutaneous blood continuously for up to 2 weeks. It has the potential to reduce the number of painful glucose checks done by pricking the finger. It is currently approved for use in the office.\n\nStudy Method A pilot using the FreeStyle Libre to assess its potential benefits in patients with diabetes starting when they are inpatients and continuing during the transition of care to the outpatient setting to see if diabetes care can be improved after discharge. To our knowledge, there are currently no studies on using CGM to help the transition of care.\n\nProtocol Outline\n\n1. Apply the FreeStyle Libre Pro to patients in the on 4-5 glucose checks per day by finger stick with insulin ordered at least 4 times per day with patient consent.\n2. Download the FreeStyle Libre each day and evaluate if the continuous data changes the treatment in the hospital.\n3. The patient will continue to wear the patch on discharge to home.\n4. At an after hospital office visit, the patient's data will again be downloaded and compared to finger stick glucoses done at home. Another evaluation well be done to see if this additional information changes therapy.\n5. Additionally, an overall evaluation will be done comparing the glucoses on the FreeStyle Libre Pro with finger stick glucoses to evaluate if the accuracy is adequate for clinical decision making.\n\nPopulation Studied Estimated number of subjects: 15 Age (inclusive) Ages 18 and above Sex (estimate M:F ratio) No sexual preference The population is patients in the hospital requiring 4-5 finger stick glucoses a day and orders on insulin. Patient should also be able to follow-up in the Diabetes Clinic to download and review the information and have no contraindication to the patch such as an adhesive allergy.\n\nRecruitment Patient consulted for diabetes management in the hospital who are on 4-5 finger stick glucoses per day and insulin will be approached.\n\nRisks and Benefits Benefits are chance to try new method of checking blood glucose. There are potential benefits if additional information improves their care. Downloads will be reviewed and shared with patients whenever possible. Risks are pain on application of the patch and possible allergies to the adhesive. (2) others: Potential benefit is improvement in diabetes care during hospitalization and transition of care. See no downside for others.\n\nAlternative Treatments Standard care will be provided to all patients. They are under no obligation to try the patch. The patient may discontinue the patch and drop out of the study at any time. If the patient elects to enroll in the study, information from the patch download may be used to modify the treatment. If and how often this happens is one of the study outcomes."

                "detailedDescription": "The incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) have increased over the last 20 years. The defining feature of diabetes mellitus (DM) is the presence of hyperglycaemia . mostly due to the progressively increasing prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, Current prevalence of DM worldwide is estimated to be about 390 million people . The Cardiovascular complications increase morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. About 40% of end-stage renal disease on regular dialysis are diabetic . Acute kidney injury (AKI) Is a fundamental problem in hospitalized patients; its incidence has been reaching 20% in middle-Europe . About 50% of patients presented with AKI are found to be diabetic ; which may indicate a direct relationship between the two conditions. In 2012, a clinical practice guideline published by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) provided a unifying definition and staging system for AKI . On the other hand, incidence of AKI in diabetic patients seems to be influenced by multiple risk Factors like severe infections, elderly, poor diabetic control, previous AKI, chronic kidney disease and drugs like SGLT2-I increase risk of AKI in diabetic patients. We aim in this study to identify the most common risk factors for AKI in diabetic patients and how those risk factors affect morbidity and mortality in patients with DM who developed AKI."

This study will look at several measures of diabetes, such as glycemic control (blood glucose/sugar levels), function of beta cells (cells that make insulin to control sugar), insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (fasting insulin levels).\n\nThe following participants will be enrolled: 1) have had COVID-19 infection and were hospitalized and recovered, or 2) have had mild COVID-19 infection and were seen at outpatient clinics or ER and were not required to be hospitalized, or 3) have not had COVID-19 infection but were seen in outpatient clinics or ER during the same time period.\n\nThe researchers hope to learn the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients. Specifically, they will be focusing on the subsequent development of diabetes and associated metabolic disturbances, such as impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. A relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes needs to be investigated."

The consistent association between pancreatic cancer and diabetes mellitus has long been recognized and even been termed as \"chicken and egg\". Many reports have found that pancreatic cancer can result in diabetes, which is called type 3c diabetes. New-onset diabetes is commonly observed in pancreatic cancer patients and has been considered as a potential screening sign. Moreover, diabetes has been found as a predictor of poor outcome in pancreatic cancer.\n\nPancreatic cancer cells have a strong dependence on glucose and they are well-known for their sweet teeth. High glucose is associated with impaired immunologic reaction, intolerability to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other major treatments, an increased risk of pancreatic surgery. Given the linkage between pancreatic cancer and diabetes or high blood glucose, a clinical trial is needed to validate the effect of metformin and insulin on regulating blood glucose in type 3c diabetes."

                "detailedDescription": "The intervention protocol\n\nStudy Design and Study Population\n\nThis study is a randomized controlled trial involving diabetic patients who smoke tobacco, attending the diabetes clinic at Penang General Hospital in Malaysia. The prevalence of smoking among patients with diabetes will be measured by reviewing the patient who visit the Endocrine department within three months. The minimum sample size needed for calculating the prevalence estimated by using the equation below:\n\n(Lwanga, S. K. and Lemeshow, S., 1991; Daniel, W. W., 1999; Cochran, W., 1977) n=(z\\^2 p (1-p))/d\\^2\n\nWhere n = the sample size; Z = the statistic for the 95% level of confidence used in the power analyses, which was 1.96; p = the expected prevalence or the proportion used, which was 0.5; and d = the precision used, which was 0.05. The estimated minimum sample size for the prevalence is 348 patients. One thousand one hundred eighteen medical records reviewed to find out the prevalence of smoking among the diabetic patients at the diabetes department in Penang General Hospital. Among those 1118 diabetic patients there were 108 smoking diabetic patients, depending on that; the prevalence of smoking among patients with diabetes will be 9.66%.\n\nThe study's participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups: diabetes-specific tobacco cessation counseling group (intervention group) and the usual physician counseling group who will stay with the routine way in diabetes care counseling at Penang general hospital (control group). Study participants in the two groups will fill-up a questionnaire form to measure their knowledge, attitude, and practice of their physicians on smoking as a part of diabetes care and as a risk factor for its deterioration and complications pre and post the intervention.\n\nEndocrinologists and physicians at the diabetic clinic will be asked to fill-up another questionnaire form to evaluate their attitude and practice in smoking cessation counselling among patients with diabetes and their willingness to apply the smoking cessation counselling in their clinics. All participants will sign an informed consent form to approve their agreement in their participation in the study.\n\nIntervention Smoking Cessation Program among the Diabetic Patients The protocol of smoking cessation consists of a routine assessment (asking) about cigarette use, advice on the importance of quitting, an assessment of tobacco user's readiness to quit, assistance to set a quit date, and arranging for follow-up visits (Fiore, M. C. et al., 2008). This protocol is popularly known as the 5A's strategy. Tobacco users will be identified by staff nurses, clinicians will provide a brief advice on quitting and the researcher will assess patient's dependence and readiness to quit. Patients who are not ready to quit will be motivated to consider doing so, whereas those who are ready to quit will be referred to practitioners who can assist and follow them up in the smoking cessation clinic (American Diabetes Association, 2004).\n\nAll participants will be asked about their willingness to participate in the study, read the patient information sheet, and sign the patient consent form to approve their agreement to participate. Those who are willing to participate will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (put letter I sticker on their records) or control group (put letter C sticker on their records). The assessment of readiness to quit smoking and nicotine dependence at baseline and after 3 and 6 months from the baseline will be done by filling the Fagerstrőm test questionnaire (FTQ) and Richmond test questionnaire. Patients will be followed for 6 months which is the standard follow-up duration for reporting data from clinical trials (Fiore, M. C. et al., 2008). Smoking abstinence or quitting will be confirmed by measuring the CO level using breath CO analyser at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of the intervention. Patients' glycaemic control, blood pressure, lipid profile, BMI, complication and comorbidities; also any quitting attempt during the study period will be recorded at the baseline and after 3 and 6 months as well from the patient's medical records and patients themselves.\n\nThe study's intervention will be delivered by physicians (who provide diabetes care to the participants), nurses and the smoking cessation clinic. The physicians will be trained on how to advise the diabetic patients to stop smoking and supported by a booklet that can help them for the wording in their counselling adapted from the guidelines. The smoking cessation clinic will help patients who are ready to quit by setting a quitting date and arranging follow-up visits for them. The intervention will be in compliance with the Malaysian guideline for the treatment of tobacco use and dependence using the 5 A's protocol (Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist, and Arrange for follow-up).\n\nRandomization\n\nIn this study we use the Stat Trek's Random Number Generator to produce the random table to randomise the study population into two groups (control and intervention). Assuming that control group number 1 and intervention group is number 2 and we allow duplicate the values in the table and by choosing the random starting point described previously in this section."

                "briefSummary": "Objective: Diabetes and periodontitis are two chronic inflammatory diseases sharing specific etiopathogenetic mechanisms, and both cause severe inflammation and destruction. The aim of the present study was to determine the receptor expressions of Peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-α, Vitamin D receptor (VDR), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expressions in healthy gingiva and diseased gingival samples with diabetes.\n\nMethods: 45 participants as 1; healthy controls (C), 2; periodontitis group (P), and 3; diabetes and periodontitis group (DP) were enrolled. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and clinical attachment levels (CAL) were recorded in all participants. Two gingival biopsies from each participant were obtained, and one underwent histological tissue processing while the other underwent RT-PCR analysis of nuclear receptors. Inflammatory and fibroblast cell counts, PPAR-γ, RXR-α, and VDR were evaluated.\n\nResults: Fibroblast cells were lowest in the DP group and highest in the healthy group. PPAR-γ, VDR, RXR, and NF-κB expressions were higher in the healthy controls in the RT-PCR analysis and similar in the other groups. Immunohistochemistry analysis also showed similar results.\n\nConclusion: Results concluded that healthy gingival samples had higher PPAR-γ, RXR, VDR, and NF-κB expressions, and the immunohistochemistry results also supported this finding. The healthy gingiva contained higher fibroblast cells and lower inflammatory cells.",
                "detailedDescription": "The present study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical Ethics Committee of Tokat Gaziosmanpasa University. The study was designed as a cross-sectional clinical study and conducted at Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University Faculty of Dentistry Department of Periodontology. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and detailed oral and radiological examination was performed by an experienced clinician (H.B.Y.).\n\nForty-two participants, 14 participants in each group, were enrolled in the study. The study groups were as follows.\n\nHealthy controls (C, mean age 41.05±1.80, seven men, seven women) Periodontitis patients with stage 3 grade B, (P, mean age 42.35±1.92, seven men, seven women) Patients with diabetes and periodontitis with stage 3 grade C, (DP, mean age 41.09±1.28, seven men, seven women)\n\nAll patients and healthy individuals went through a detailed oral examination, and periodontal health and periodontitis diagnosis were based on the criteria defined by the recent classification of periodontal health and diseases in the 2017 International World Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions \\[21\\].\n\nAll participants were never smokers. Exclusion criteria were conditions which might affect the inflammatory state, the existence of less than ten or over missing teeth, tobacco or any drug use, presence of pregnancy or lactation, and existence of antibiotic or periodontal therapy within previous six months. Diabetes patients in the present study had HbA1c values greater than 7.0 even though they were under diabetic treatment. And the diabetic patients who had HbA1c values below 7.0 were not included.\n\nClinical measurements Clinical parameters were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI) and clinical attachment levels (CAL), and all analyses were performed before the biopsy procedure. Full mouth measurements and the measurements of the relevant teeth were recorded separately. CAL was measured from the cement-enamel junction to the bottom of the periodontal pocket and Williams's type periodontal probe was used for measurements (Hu-Friedy Co., Chicago, IL, USA). PI and GI measurements were performed via an explorer (Hu-Friedy Co., Chicago, IL, USA). All analyses were performed from six points, three from buccal aspect and three from the palatal aspect as mesial, middle, and distal sites for both teeth. A mean value of six measurements was recorded.\n\nCollection of Gingival Samples Gingival biopsies were obtained according to a protocol by a previous study \\[22\\]. Two gingival biopsies were obtained from each participant. Gingival sampling in periodontally healthy individuals was performed by crown lengthening procedure in the routine treatment protocol or before orthodontically indicated tooth extraction. In the periodontitis groups, biopsies were obtained from the inflamed gingival tissue with minor surgical periodontal procedures. All biopsies were obtained from posterior maxillary teeth (tooth #4, #5, #6 or #7).\n\nFirstly, local anesthesia was performed, and a gingival sample was dissected with a tissue scissor from an area with requiring either gingivectomy/crown lengthening procedures from patients with impaired gingival topography or before tooth extraction indicated for orthodontic treatment in healthy individuals. As for the periodontitis patients, a gingival sample was dissected using a tissue scissor during the scaling and root planning procedure from the gingival areas with severe gingival inflammation. One gingival sample from each participant was immediately placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours and underwent histological tissue processing. The other samples of each participant were immediately frozen at -80⁰C until the day of analysis.\n\nHistopathological Evaluation All histological procedures were performed by an experienced blinded researcher (F.G.). Gingival samples which underwent histological tissue processing were first washed and cleansed from formalin and were dehydrated with alcohol series. Then all tissues were cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin blocks. Each block sectioned throughout as serial sections and three sections from each block were selected for Hematoxylin-eosin (H\\&E) staining. Fibroblast and inflammatory cell infiltration were evaluated from H\\&E stained slides under 1000x magnification via a light microscope .\n\nFor fibroblast and inflammatory cell evaluation, the gingival area at the connective tissue border neighboring gingival epithelium was evaluated. A cell counting frame of 10.000 µm2 area was selected under 1000x magnification. The total inflammatory cells (neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and macrophage cells) within the frame were counted as inflammatory cell counting. The fibroblasts were also counted likewise. The measurements were performed from three different points, and the mean of these three measurements was recorded \\[23\\].\n\nPPAR-γ, RXR-α, and VDR Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed as reported in previous studies \\[23-26\\]. Three sections were chosen for each immunohistochemistry staining from each participant. Firstly, all slides were deparaffinized and dehydrated with alcohol series. After washing with distilled water, antigen retrieval was performed via sodium citrate buﬀer (pH 6.0) for two h at 70°C, and then endogenous peroxidase activity was suppressed with 3% hydrogen peroxide treatment. After hydrogen peroxide treatment, all slides were incubated with normal rabbit serum for 30 min. After normal serum incubation, primary antibody diluents were prepared and applied to the samples overnight at a humidified chamber at 4⁰C. The primary antibodies were goat polyclonal anti-PPAR-γ antibody (1:250), anti-RXR-α antibody (1:250), and anti-VDR antibody (1:250). After primary antibody incubation, all slides were washed with phosphate buffer solution (PBS) three times for five minutes (3x5) and biotinylated immunoglobulin G was applied for 30 min. Again a wash of 3x5 PBS, all samples were exposed to a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated reagent for another 30 min. After washed with 3x5 PBS, all sections were treated with AEC chromogen to visualize staining. Counterstaining was performed with Meyer's hematoxylin, and sections were mounted. After allowing dry for two days, samples were examined under 400x magnification using light microscopy \\[23, 24\\].\n\nImmunohistochemical semi-quantitative H SCORE Analysis Immunohistochemistry evaluation was performed on three different areas in each section, and three sections were evaluated for each patient. Nine measurements were performed for each participant. All cells were marked according to their staining as no staining '0', low staining '1', mild staining '2', and dense staining '3'. Staining scores were converted to a numeric value as 'H score' through a formula (∑Pi(i+l)) which is a frequently used value for immunohistochemistry \\[23, 24\\]. In this formula, i shows the staining intensity score and Pi: indicates the percentage of the stained cells.\n\nRT-PCR Analysis The primers to be used for the genes were shown in table 1. The RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis performed according to a previous study \\[27\\]. Briefly, for RT-PCR analysis, first gingival tissues were homogenized and subjected to sonication to reveal RNA in the tissues and tissue supernatants were obtained. Then the supernatants were submitted to the total mRNA isolation step. The tissues treated with Qiazole, then allowed to incubate in the shaker for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, chloroform was added to the medium containing the cells and incubation continued for 3 minutes at room temperature and then the samples were centrifuged. At the end of the centrifuge, the supernatant at the top of the tube transferred to another tube. Afterward, isopropanol was added to the supernatant and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, and the centrifugation step was repeated. At the end of the centrifugation, the pellet deposited at the bottom was washed with 75% ethanol, remaining supernatant was centrifuged again and suspended in pure, sterile water without RNase. mRNAs were determined by spectrophotometric method. Then using the qRT-PCR kit, one µg mRNA were transformed into single-step cDNA using specific primers targeting the gene of interest, later the genes were identified with the help of qRT-PCR (Verso, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). The results were normalized to the β-actin control gene.\n\nStatistical Analysis The power of the study was over 85% based on a previous study with a similar study design \\[25\\]. IBM SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. One Sample K-S test was used to test the normality. For the fibroblast cell counts, inflammatory cell counts, and CAL, One Way ANOVA followed by Tukey test used. For other parameters, Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests were used. Data were presented as mean ± SD or percentage as appropriate. p \\< 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

                "briefSummary": "Objectives The aim of this intervention is to assess how well and how efficiently the O2O Service Model works in delivering primary healthcare and managing chronic diseases for patients living in Pyeongchang-gun at the local government level.\n\nTrial design This is a randomized controlled trial with restricted, batch, blocked and individual random assignment. Investigators will allocate 1,000 participants from Pyeongchang-gun into two groups: one with diabetes (and pre-diabetes) and one with hypertension (including borderline cases), focusing on poorly controlled patients. As participants visit local health centers, their data will be sent to the research team for blocked randomization based on disease type, severity, and region. Assignment results will be communicated back to the centers and patients.\n\nStudy setting The intervention will take place in Pyeongchang-gun, Kangwon-do, South Korea. The Smart Healthcare Center affiliated to Public Medical Center of Pyeongchang will primarily manage the O2O service by providing necessary education and human resources while receiving and monitoring data from each participant and local medical centers. The overall study (including the design of trial) is managed by Seoul National University College of Medicine while the provision of O2O service and data collection are primarily in charge of Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang.\n\nIntervention in O2O Service Model:\n\nAfter initial health exams, each patient gets a custom care plan, classifying their disease and care level. The Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center, with doctors, tracks patients via an online platform, sending automated health messages. High-risk patients receive a two-week glucose monitor and guidance on lifestyle adjustments. Doctors access patient health records through the participant's personal online datastore (POD), with consent, integrating health and prescription history from national insurance, and can assess heart disease risk.\n\nSample size The trial's sample size is determined using the MDES(Minimum Detectable Effect Size), with 1,000 participants divided equally between diabetes and hypertension groups. Each group is then split into treatment and control subgroups through random allocation. The MDES calculation, accounting for an explained outcome variation of 50% due to blocking and controls, and based on 500 subjects per group with equal allocation, aims for a high-accuracy effect size of 0.216 at a 5% significance level and 80% power.\n\nAssignment of interventions: allocation Participants will be randomly placed into groups by a computer program. This study uses a specific randomization method that is restricted and organized by individual characteristics. The research team will tell the centers and patients about their group assignment via phone and email. Neither the healthcare staff nor the participants will know the group allocation beforehand. The research team is in charge of the randomization process and informing everyone involved. The staff at Pyeongchang's Smart Healthcare Center will sign up participants and manage their placement into the assigned intervention groups. There will be no blinding after participants are assigned to their groups.\n\nList of Data For the study, the investigators have created questionnaires and interview formats to collect various data types, including random assignment records, baseline information, outcomes, service usage and costs, demographic and health details, physician-collected health records, life-log data from apps or web, clinical exam results, and service effectiveness and efficiency from the perspective of medical staff and administrators.\n\nStatistical methods For the analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will employ ITT(Intention-to-Treat) and Regression-Adjusted Impact Estimate. When data allows (especially data from control group), the investigators will also conduct timeseries effect analysis. To investigate the time-series changes in program effects across multiple time points, the dependent variable (outcome variable) should be measured at each time point to estimate program effects repeatedly.\n\nData management and monitoring The data management for the study will be conducted using electronic systems for secure and accurate data entry, coding, and storage, with robust checks and backups to ensure data quality, which will be archived for three years in compliance with bioethics standards before disposal according to privacy regulations. Participant confidentiality is prioritized through secure data collection and restricted access, with sharing only to authorized research team members and regulators using password protection or encryption. Additionally, a dedicated Data Monitoring Committee will oversee trial progress and adherence to protocols, while the Smart Healthcare Center collaborates with healthcare workers to manage patient services, with minimal adverse events expected.",
                "detailedDescription": "Objectives The objective of this intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Online-to-Offline(O2O) Service Model developed to provide primary healthcare and management of chronic diseases targeting patients residing in Pyeongchang-gun at the local government level.\n\nThe randomized controlled trial of this intervention will help verifying the model, and provide valuable information about the effectiveness of an O2O digital healthcare service for patients with diabetes and hypertension. If the intervention is found to be effective, it has the potential to improve access to care and self-management for patients, which could lead to improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. The implications from this study can also serve as credible evidence for decision making for provision of digital health care services in other regions of Korea as well.\n\nTrial design This is a randomized controlled trial with restricted, batch, blocked and individual random assignment. For sampling before randomization, investigators plan to recruit two target disease groups in Pyeongchang-gun: one group with diabetes patients (including pre-diabetes patients), and another with hypertension patients (including borderline hypertension patients). Total 1,000 participants (500 per group) will be recruited, and the investigators plan to prioritize the poorly controlled patients when recruiting.\n\nPrimary mode of sampling is voluntary based, where patients sign up through the advertisement, promotional campaign, or information provided by the physicians. Some patients will be recommended and informed to join this trial by their physicians while promotional/advertising materials will be posted at participating medical centers((i.e., Pyeongchang Public Medical Center and local private clinic, local private medical centres in Pyeongchang) and the Pyeongchang official website. Flyers will also be distributed through voluntary village health supporting groups-named Village Health Committee. In the meantime, for patients who have already diagnosed to have diabetes and hypertension will also be recruited from participating medical centres in Pyeongchang (i.e., local medical centres, Pyeongchang Public Medical center).\n\nWhen eligible patients who are willing to participate in this study visits local health centre for clinical tests, their data will be periodically sent to the research team to carry out blocked random assignment (block: disease, severity, region). The assignment results are notified to the centre/clinic and then to the patients. The allocation ratio is 1:1 for each disease (hypertension and diabetes).\n\nStudy setting The intervention will take place in Pyeongchang-gun, Kangwon-do, South Korea. (Pyeongchang-gun is a county in the province of Gangwon-do, South Korea. It is in the eastern part of the province with a population of around 43 thousand people estimated in 2020.) The Smart Healthcare Center affiliated to Public Medical Center of Pyeongchang will primarily manage the O2O service by providing necessary education and human resources while receiving and monitoring data from each participant and local medical centers.\n\nAs mentioned, the intervention targets patients (and borderline patients) in Pyeongchang, and the data is collected from participating patients through the device and application as well as from the local medical centers when patients participate in (both control and treatment group) regular follow-ups.\n\nThe overall study (including the design of trial) is managed by Seoul National University College of Medicine while the provision of O2O service and data collection are primarily in charge of Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang. There are stakeholders to develop and manage the O2O model (specifically the mobile application, data platform), such as Kangbuk Samsung Hospital, Huray and DKI, and Seoul National University Hospital as well as XAIMED are in charge of managing the Public Health HRecord (PHR) data collected from the patients and local medical centers.\n\nInterventions\n\nIntervention in O2O Service Model:\n\nFollowing baseline comprehensive health examinations, each participant's primary attending physician will develop an individualized care plan. This care plan includes identifying the representative disease group (diabetes, pre-diabetes, hypertension, borderline-hypertension) and determining the intensity of care (intensive or standard). In cases where participants have both diabetes and hypertension, they are categorized as diabetes patients. Participants with poorly controlled diseases (systolic blood pressure exceeding 140 or diastolic pressure over 90 in the hypertension group, and HbA1c levels exceeding 6.5% in the diabetes group) are assigned to the intensive care group. However, these classifications can be adjusted as necessary based on the patient's clinical condition.\n\nThe Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center, in collaboration with physicians, continuously monitors and intervenes as needed. Monitoring occurs through the administrator's web page of the O2O service platform, allowing oversight of the life-log data of the intervention group. Enrolled patients receive interventions in the form of automated or manual messages.\n\n- Message Delivery through the Application: Personalized Educational Material: The content of these messages is determined based on the participant's baseline evaluation results. They consist of publicly available videos produced by reputable organizations, including academic societies, and are provided via links to YouTube videos.\n\nHealth Reports: Sent every three months, these reports provide a comprehensive evaluation of whether the individual's condition is being well managed based on life-log data from the past three months.\n\nManual Messages (Texted Messages): Indicator-based personalized messages are manually transcribed, evaluating the state of health management over the last two or four weeks based on life-log data. These messages are primarily drafted by the Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center, using pre-made message templates created by healthcare experts (doctors, nutritionists, nurses, etc.) suitable for each situation. Messages are sent to patients after final confirmation by their respective primary physicians. Additional messages can be sent as needed during the monitoring process, especially if blood pressure or blood glucose levels are at cautionary or dangerous levels or if data entry is insufficient.\n\n- Continuous Glucose Monitor (Among the Intervention Group): Some diabetes patients in the intervention group will be provided with a continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre). Eligibility for this monitor is determined based on their recorded glucose levels not reaching the normal range in more than half of their recent examinations within the latest 14 days. Patients eligible for the continuous glucose monitor receive notifications via text or phone call from the Smart Healthcare Center. They are required to attach the device for two weeks and are advised to self-monitor their glucose variations. During this period, they are strongly encouraged to manage their glucose levels by adapting their usual lifestyle. Some patients may receive the monitor again, if needed, two weeks after the detachment of the device.\n\n- Personal Health Record (PHR) Data: PHR data can be accessed and utilized exclusively by attending physicians with patient consent through the participant's personal online datastore (POD) web view in the clinic. POD can import health screening results, medical history, and prescription history provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), which is mandatory for all citizens to enroll in. Additionally, POD contains AI-based retinal image analysis capable of detecting ophthalmologic abnormalities (e.g., glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy) and predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk. It also includes another CVD incidence prediction model developed using national health screening data. With access to this PHR data, attending physicians can provide comprehensive consultations to patients regarding their CVD risk.\n\n- Control Group: The control group will receive treatment as usual, which is the typical care provided to individuals without the additional interventions described above.\n\nStrategies to improve adherence to interventions Patients will be regularly reminded to use the mobile-app to check up their medical conditions with mobile alarms, notifications and in-person notification from the Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang Medical Center\n\nRelevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial Treat of as usual (TAU) is allowed for both control and treatment group. However, the investigators believe that patients' participation in alternative services will be the most difficult problem to solve during the study. The investigators have identified 'participating in another research program involving smart health technology' as one of the exclusion criteria. will not be eligible for inclusion in our study. At the same time, the investigators will further prevent concomitant care (that might be possible during the intervention) through information provision and by educating the operators who will be in charge of training and informing the patients for service utilization\n\nSample size Sample size is calculated using MDES (Minimum Detectable Effect Size) equation. The sample size for this study is determined with the aim of detecting a meaningful difference between the treatment and control groups with sufficient statistical power. Given that the total sample size is 1000 participants, the investigators will divide this cohort into two main groups: participants with diabetes and those with hypertension. Subsequently, each of these two groups will be randomly allocated into treatment and control subgroups. Calculation of MDES is separately carried out for the diabetes and hypertension groups, taking into account the unique characteristics and expected effect sizes within each group.\n\nAssuming that the variation in the outcome variable that can be explained by blocked random assignment and control variable is about 50%, and assuming a sample of 500 subjects with a 5:5 allocation ratio, with a statistical significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, the MDES is 0.216. If the investigators assume that the variation in the outcome variable that can be explained by blocked random assignment and control variable is about 25%, the MDES is 0.187, which is still high in accuracy. Assuming that the variation in the outcome variable that can be explained by blocked random assignment and control variable is about 10%, the MDES is 0.181, which is still high in accuracy. (Note: Cohen (1988) suggested that an MDES of 0.20 is a small effect size, 0.50 is a medium effect size, and 0.80 is a large effect size.) Therefore, the investigators aim to recruit the sample of 500 participants for each disease type, and the treatment-to-control ration is 5:5 for each disease group\n\nRecruitment There are two concurrent recruitment procedures, each with slight distinction. Procedure 1 primarily targets patients previously diagnosed with diabetes, pre-diabetes, hypertension, or borderline hypertension. Procedure 2 targets respondents who have been exposed to our promotion and advertisement efforts. For these respondents who voluntarily asked to enroll, their eligibility will be confirmed when they are either: 1) Previously diagnosed with diabetes, borderline diabetes, hypertension, or borderline hypertension (with proof of diagnosis) or 2) Newly diagnosed with any of these conditions through the comprehensive health check-up included in this intervention procedure.\n\nAssignment of interventions: allocation Sequence generation Participants will be randomized using a computer-generated randomization sequence. This study will apply a restricted, batch, blocked, individual random assignment. After screening the participant eligibility, each eligible participant will be contacted to receive informed consent. For those who consented to participate will visit the local medical center (or smart healthcare center) for detailed explanation of service, to physically signed the agreement, receive training to use the mobile app, and respond the survey. After patients receive clinical tests at the clinic, the list of patients and test results are periodically sent to the research team. The research team conducts blocked random assignment periodically based on disease, severity, and region. The assignment results are notified to the center and clinic and then to the patients by the research team. Such process is designed to align to the O2O service process.\n\nConcealment mechanism Mechanism of implementing the allocation sequence is using central telephone and email. The health care staffs and participants won't know the allocation until the research team inform them.\n\nImplementation The research team will generate the allocation sequence, deliver the allocation results to the center and patients directly. The staffs of Smart Healthcare Center of Pyeongchang Public Medical Center will enroll participants and assign participants to interventions.\n\nAssignment of interventions: Blinding Who will be blinded Once the random assignment is conducted, no blinding will take place for this study.\n\nData collection and management Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes\n\nData Quality Assurance:\n\nTo ensure the integrity of our survey data, the investigators have implemented several processes to promote data quality. First, the investigators plan to employ duplication risk mitigation measures by cross-referencing participant phone numbers and birth dates. This step helps identify and rectify any duplicate entries, maintaining the accuracy and uniqueness of our dataset.\n\nSecond, our assessors will be rigorously trained to conduct surveys effectively. The investigators have developed a comprehensive manual guide to standardize data collection procedures. This guide serves as a valuable resource for our assessors, ensuring consistency and adherence to established protocols.\n\nFurthermore, prior to the commencement of the intervention, the assessors will also undergo a pre-intervention session. During this session, they will receive training on data collection processes, ensuring their familiarity with survey instruments and questionnaires.\n\nAdditionally, our Smart Healthcare Center plays a pivotal role as a call center, promptly addressing any issues or queries that may arise during data collection. This continuous support mechanism helps maintain data quality throughout the study.\n\nStudy Instruments:\n\nFor data collection, the investigators have developed survey questionnaires and interview guides. These instruments have been meticulously crafted, drawing from health outcome indicators aligned with clinical guidelines. This alignment ensures that our data collection tools are both relevant and comprehensive, enabling us to capture essential information related to our study objectives.\n\nOur commitment to data quality and the robustness of our study instruments underpins the reliability and validity of the data collected, ensuring the credibility of our research findings.\n\nList of Data Data to be collected for this study can be categorized into 'Record of Random 'Assignment,' 'Baseline,' 'Outcome,' 'Service Utilization data,' 'Service Cost Data'.\n\nPlans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up\n\nThe research team's strategy to retain the completeness of random assignment while managing any contamination or drop-out is the following:\n\n* Conduct a pilot random assignment for about a week to identify any issues.\n* Continuously check the size of Treatment group (T) and Comparison group © considering the sample size by group to monitor the possibility of non-random assignment.\n* Issue of random assignment of ineligible applicants: If found in both T and C, they will be dropped from the sample; if found only in T, no-show adjustment will be made at the analysis stage.\n* Control group contamination:\n\n  1. Identify Contamination by participants vs. contamination by operators\n  2. Education for operators\n  3. Minimizing face-to-face contact between operators and participants\n  4. Direct notification of random assignment results to participants by the research team\n* Cross-over: When the controller applies for random allocation again. Do not remove from the sample, but handle as no-show adjustment at the analysis stage.\n\nThe field operators (i.e., staffs of Smart Healthcare Center and Public Medical Center of Pyeongchang) will regularly check-up with the patients to remind them to use the mobile application, while the patients will be automatically notified via app notification and e-mails for service use. When participants request discontinuation, they will be asked to fill out the follow-up survey and their medical records (from medical centers and National Health Insurance Service) will be collected at the point of discontinuation. For deviated participants, medical records (from medical centers and National Insurance Service) will be collected when the deviation is identified.\n\nData management\n\nThe data management plan is the following for each process:\n\nData entry: All data will be entered using electronic data capture (EDC) software. Two independent operators will perform double data entry for accuracy.\n\nCoding: A coding manual will be created to ensure consistency in coding. All coded data will be verified by a second operator for accuracy.\n\nSecurity: Access to the data will be password-protected, and only authorized personnel will have access. The data will be stored on a secure server that is regularly backed up.\n\nStorage: The data will be stored in an electronic format. The data will be stored on a secure server located within the research institution.\n\nData quality processes: Range checks will be performed to ensure that data values fall within acceptable ranges. Data cleaning procedures will be performed to correct any discrepancies or missing data. The final dataset will be verified for completeness and accuracy by the research team before analysis.\n\nBackup and archiving: The data will be regularly backed up to ensure its integrity in case of system failure or loss. A copy of the final dataset will be archived in a secure location for future reference. According to Article 15 of the Enforcement Rules of the Bioethics and Safety Act, all research-related records and data will be archived for three years from the end of the research.\n\nData Disposal: Seoul National University, an institution that is in charge of retention, will dispose of any data and document containing personal information in accordance with Article 16 of Enforcement Decree of the Personal Information Protection Act after three years of archiving.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nThe investigators will collect personal information about potential and enrolled participants through informed consent forms, medical records, and questionnaires. The investigators will ensure that all personal information is securely stored and accessed only by authorized personnel. The investigators will share personal information only with the research team and regulatory agencies, and the investigators will do so through password-protected access or encryption to ensure confidentiality.\n\nThe specific protocols are as follows:\n\nThe participant is provided with sufficient explanation and, if voluntarily agreed, signs a written consent form to participate in the research.\n\nConfidentiality will be maintained for information that can identify the personal information.\n\nInformation can be provided if the participant inquires about the test results. The participant's data file will be stored on the server of the data management personnel. This server is accessible only to the principal investigator, research staff, and co-researchers, and the file is encrypted. Therefore, access is not possible except for those who participated in this research.\n\nThe data file collected during the research process will be provided to a third party (National Health Smart Management Research and Development Division under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Government of South Korea) and submitted to the data platform (big data and personal data repository) established by the division. In this process, personal information is protected by applying the integrated authentication system and DID (Decentralized Identifier, a distributed identification technology based on blockchain technology) system developed by the division.\n\nStatistical methods For the analysis of primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will employ ITT(Intention-to-Treat) and Regression-Adjusted Impact Estimate.\n\nWhen data allows (especially data from control group), the investigators will also conduct timeseries effect analysis. The occurrence of program effects and how these effects change over time are crucial pieces of information to be derived from this experimental study. Analysing the temporal trajectory of program effects is essential, as the timing of impact and the nature of the program can result in diverse patterns of change based on the severity of disease or behavioural patterns of patients.\n\nIn randomized experiments, comparability between randomly assigned program and control groups remains consistent over time. Therefore, analysing the time-series changes in program effects can be achieved by applying cross-sectional analysis methods (i.e., Equation (1)) at each time point. To investigate the time-series changes in program effects across multiple time points, the dependent variable (outcome variable) should be measured at each time point to estimate program effects repeatedly. It's important to note that, in Equation (1), the variables that change over time are the dependent variables only, while program variables and control variables remain constant. This is because, the distinction between program and control groups should not change over time, and control variables should be obtained prior to random allocation.\n\nAn important consideration for this analysis is that the \"time\" mentioned is relative, not absolute. It is measured relative to the random assignment date, not an absolute calendar year. Therefore, evaluators will record the random assignment date for all sample members and integrate it into the analysis dataset. The dependent variables obtained from administrative statistical databases should also be transformed into relative time variables based on the random assignment date for analysis.\n\nMethods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data\n\nDefiers in the Treatment Group: In the event that there is non-adherence to the protocol, particularly if there are individuals who defy the assigned treatment, the investigators will estimate the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). Since the control group will not be provided with the application, there is no possibility of 'defiers' in the control group. Therefore, the investigators will simply divide the ITT with the rate of compliers.\n\nLATE= ITT/(Rate of Compliers (in Treatment Group)) To address missing data for variables of interest, the investigators will use a missing-dummy approach, specifically employing dummy variable adjustment. This method involves creating dummy variables to account for missing data and subsequently including these dummy variables in our analysis as covariates. This approach allows us to compensate for missing data and maintain the completeness of our analysis while minimizing the impact of missing observations on our results.\n\nOversight and monitoring Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee Composition and Roles of Key Entities: The O2O service is orchestrated by a collaborative effort between the \"Smart Healthcare Center\" personnel and healthcare professionals situated at each patient's primary care clinic. The Smart Healthcare Center operates under the umbrella of the Public Health Center (PHC) of Pyeongchang-gun and comprises our dedicated team of researchers alongside PHC staff members.\n\nComposition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprises members from the evaluation team, ensuring a diverse range of expertise to oversee the trial's data and processes. The Data Monitoring Committee plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and quality of trial data. Its responsibilities include monthly monitoring and feedback sessions to assess the trial's progress and adherence to protocols. The Data Monitoring Committee reports its findings directly to the Principal Investigator (PI), providing valuable insights and recommendations to enhance the trial's efficacy and safety.\n\nImportantly, the Data Monitoring Committee operates independently from the intervention itself. Its members do not have direct involvement with participating medical centers and the Pyeongchang Smart Healthcare Center. This independence ensures unbiased evaluation and decision-making regarding the trial's progress and safety.\n\nAdverse event reporting and harms The likelihood of adverse events or unintended effects related to trial interventions or trial conduct is not anticipated to be high. However, in the event that such occurrences do arise, our response protocol is well-established. Any solicited or spontaneously reported adverse events will be promptly reported to the Principal Investigator (PI) overseeing the trial. Simultaneously, these events will be reported to the Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) Committee, the regulatory body responsible for overseeing the ethical and safety aspects of the trial. Upon notification of an adverse event or unintended effect, relevant and appropriate actions will be taken in response. These actions may include further investigation, adjustments to trial conduct, or any necessary modifications to ensure participant safety and the integrity of the trial."

The algorithm examines daily glucose, insulin, and meal data to make changes in patients' basal injections and ICRs. The investigators hope that this algorithm will be able to optimize the patients' individual basal injections and ICRs in order to improve glycemic control.",
                "detailedDescription": "The objective of this project is to compare our basal-bolus optimization algorithm with physician adjusted basal-bolus parameters using a randomized parallel clinical trial in children and adolescents at a Camp Carowanis. The investigators hypothesize that using this optimization algorithm will be non-inferior to the physician-adjusted basal-bolus parameters regarding time spent in target glucose range (3.9 mmol/L - 10mmol/L).\n\nBetween 40 and 68 children and adolescent type 1 diabetes patients undergoing MDI treatment at Camp Carowanis will randomly undergo one of two interventions:\n\n1. MDI with Physician Adjusted Basal-Bolus Parameters: Participants will be wearing the Freestyle Libre glucose sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care). Participants will undergo their conventional multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. At breakfast, the research team will download the sensor data. Camp physicians will review each participant's sensor and insulin data and make changes to their parameters based on their clinical judgement, as they would for all campers, regardless of study participation. These new parameters will be entered into the patient's camp file.\n2. MDI with Basal-Bolus Optimization Algorithm Adjusted Basal-Bolus Parameters: Participants will be wearing the Freestyle Libre glucose sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care). At breakfast, the data from the glucose sensor and injection information will be entered into a computer and the optimization algorithm will be run. Camp physicians will review the algorithm's recommendations before they are entered into the patient's camp file."

These long acting insulins are designed to dissipate slowly and evenly into the bloodstream for 24 to 36 hours following injection. This basal injection aims to mimic the physiological healthy basal insulin released from a healthy pancreas all day. Furthermore, multiple insulin bolus doses are injected at every meal each day using rapid or short acting insulin. These injections are administered before meals and are calculated using patients' ICRs and meal carbohydrate quantities.",

We are going to evaluate this system in an evidence-based medicine view, taking diabetic retinopathy as an example. And clinical diagnostic criteria will be made based on this multi-modal artificial intelligence imaging diagnostic system. The study is designed as a cross-sectional study involving 1,000 normal individuals, 1,000 diabetes patients without ocular complications, and 1,000 with diabetic ocular complications. Statistical analysis of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the artificial intelligence system will be made, and ROC curve wil be draw."

                "briefSummary": "Brief description:\n\nDiabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is described as a full-thickness lesion appearing at the skin of the foot along with infection, destruction of tissues due to neuropathy and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD) in people with diabetes (International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, 2015). DFU commonly develops in middle-aged diabetic patients due to a long period of type 2 diabetes and poor adherence to control blood glucose level (Madanchi et al., 2013). Prevalence of DFU was four times higher than all combined cases of cancers in the world (Boulton, 2013; McInnes, 2012; Shaw, Sicree, \\& Zimmet, 2010). Numerous published studies have documented the rate of DFU at around 25% in Western Population (Boulton, 2013). Prevalence of DFU was stated between 7.3 % - 24 % at Indonesia hospitals (Soewondo, Ferrario, \\& Tahapary, 2013). An Indonesia nursing study recorded 12 % of diabetic foot ulcer cases from 249 individuals with type 2 diabetes in a regional hospital of Eastern Indonesia (Yusuf et al., 2015). Cases of infected DFU occurred in 98 patients in Sardjito Hospital Yogyakarta Indonesia in 2016 (Longdong, 2016).\n\nIn order to diminish the wide-reaching impact of DFU, a number of efforts have been performed in Indonesia. A study documented that sufficient diabetic patients' knowledge in performing foot care is able to decrease the incidence of DFU as well as LEA (Wulandini, Saputra, \\& Basri, 2013). Foot ulcers health education program was interrelated with patients' knowledge as well as attitudes concerning responsibility and involvement in DFU care (Arianti, Yetti, \\& Nasution, 2012; Mahfud, 2012; Sa'adah, Primanda, \\& Wardaningsih, 2016; Yoyoh, Mutaqqin, \\& Nurjanah, 2016). In line with their findings, another study confirmed that intensive health promotion increased patients' knowledge and practice in regard to perform routine foot care (Abbas, 2013). Also, health promotion intervention improves Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in type 2 Diabetes (Brown, 1990; Norris, Lau, Smith, Schmid, \\& Engelgau, 2002; Florkowski, 2013). However, a number of these studies merely focused on the patient, not engaged family members as it may potentially reduce the effectiveness of therapy.\n\nAccordingly, DFU is currently being a critical problems needs to be solved in Indonesia. Ensuring the engagement of both the patients and their families in treatment is an important strategy to deal with the chronic conditions (Baig, Benitez, Quinn, \\& Burnet, 2015; Miller \\& DiMatteo, 2013; Pamungkas, Chamroonsawasdi, \\& Vatanasomboon, 2017). Therefore, conducting a comprehensive intervention of DFU partnering individuals and their families in association with self-and family management is a groundbreaking and challenging strategy to overcome problems on DFU. We believe the findings of our study will render significant contributions to the national guideline of diabetes in Indonesia and prevention of LEA in nursing practice. Furthermore, it will be able to give promising results for accelerating DFU healing.\n\nPurposes of the study:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a self- and family management of DFU programs on health outcomes as follows: behaviors (adherence to physical activities, medications, diet, foot care, and blood glucose control), family supports, biomarkers (HbA1c, wound size) in patients suffering DFU in Indonesia.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe study participants who joined completely the self- and family management of diabetic foot ulcer programs during three months would have a better behavior, biomarkers, and family supports than those who received the usual care.",
                "detailedDescription": "Study background:\n\nDiabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is described as a full-thickness lesion appearing at the skin of the foot along with infection, destruction of tissues due to neuropathy and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD) in people with diabetes (International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, 2015). DFU commonly develops in middle-aged diabetic patients due to a long period of type 2 diabetes and poor adherence to control blood glucose level (Madanchi et al., 2013).

Numerous published studies have documented the rate of DFU at around 25% in Western Population (Boulton, 2013). Prevalence of DFU was stated between 7.3 % - 24 % at Indonesia hospitals (Soewondo, Ferrario, \\& Tahapary, 2013). An Indonesia nursing study recorded 12 % of diabetic foot ulcer cases from 249 individuals with type 2 diabetes in a regional hospital of Eastern Indonesia (Yusuf et al., 2015). Cases of infected DFU occurred in 98 patients in Sardjito Hospital Yogyakarta Indonesia in 2016 (Longdong, 2016).\n\nIn long-term conditions, DFU leads to lower extremity amputation (LEA) (Pemayun, Naibaho, Novitasari, Amin, \\& Minuljo, 2016). Several factors relating to LEA were ischemia, neuropathy, end-stage renal disease, and depth of the wound along with infection (Widatalla, Mahadi, Shawer, Elsayem, \\& Ahmed, 2009). The incidence of LEA was forecasted to be more than a million per year (Peter-Riesch, 2016; Wu, Driver, Wrobel, \\& Armstrong, 2007). Two studies exposed that amputation procedures were performed every 20 seconds in the diabetic population in the world (Fejfarová et al., 2014). A recent study found the estimated range of amputations around 15 - 32 % in Indonesia (Soewondo et al., 2017). As a consequence, this condition will directly impact on the patient's health-related quality of life that encompasses physical, social, economic, and psychological aspects (Vileikyte, 2001).\n\nIn order to diminish the wide-reaching impact of DFU, a number of efforts have been performed in Indonesia. A study documented that sufficient diabetic patients' knowledge in performing foot care is able to decrease the incidence of DFU as well as LEA (Wulandini, Saputra, \\& Basri, 2013). Foot ulcers health education program was interrelated with patients' knowledge as well as attitudes concerning responsibility and involvement in DFU care (Arianti, Yetti, \\& Nasution, 2012; Mahfud, 2012; Sa'adah, Primanda, \\& Wardaningsih, 2016; Yoyoh, Mutaqqin, \\& Nurjanah, 2016). In line with their findings, another study confirmed that intensive health promotion increased patients' knowledge and practice in regard to perform routine foot care (Abbas, 2013). Also, health promotion intervention improves Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in type 2 Diabetes (Brown, 1990; Norris, Lau, Smith, Schmid, \\& Engelgau, 2002; Florkowski, 2013). However, a number of these studies merely focused on the patient, not engaged family members as it may potentially reduce the effectiveness of therapy.\n\nCurrently, poor adherence to DFU treatment is taken into consideration on the diabetes population in Indonesia. Many diabetic patients had poor adherence in maintaining diabetes treatment which potentially leads to suboptimal diabetes outcomes involving increased blood glucose level, more hospital admissions, diabetes-related complications, and multiplied medical care costs (Putri, Yudianto, Kurniawan, \\& Titis, 2013; Waluya, 2008). To overcome this issue, intensive health promotion has been considered as the first-line approach in Indonesia (Windasari, 2014). In addition, strategies addressing poor adherence must be focused on reducing DFU complications in the future. This could be successfully achieved by incorporating family members in a particular intervention. A systematic review also pointed out that family support in a given treatment strengthens patient adherence to diabetes treatment (Rintala, Jaatinen, Paavilainen, \\& Astedt-Kurki, 2013). Efforts have been performed in Indonesia, even though it has some limitations. For instance, some studies merely addressed the age, gender, duration of diabetes and level of patient' education relating to the adherence, not focused on patients' motivation which is presently being the main problem in Indonesia (Ainni, 2017; Srikartika, Cahya, \\& Hardiati, 2016). Also, providing care to those suffering diabetes potentially becomes a burden on both physical and emotional aspects. Also, some individuals reported that they felt sadness when their family does not fully support their care. In line with these findings that, negative family support is the robust predictor for the patient's stress and decreased diabetes outcome (Pardamean \\& Dharmady, 2003; Isworo, Ekowati, Iskandar, \\& Latifah, 2018). The other study stated that patients receiving non-supportive care from a family member are more likely to have a poor blood glucose level (Isworo \\& Saryono, 2010). Moreover, the lack of family knowledge, low levels of self-efficacy, and insufficient social support from family members lead to poor diabetes self-management (Pamungkas, Chamroonsawasdi, \\& Vatanasomboon, 2017).\n\nDue to the positive influence of family support on diabetes outcomes, the high-impact efforts to improve family support are considered to be necessary. Many studies described the family involvement in diabetes care consisting of providing emotional support, helping patients how to deal with diabetes problems, providing information and partnering in daily care. Nevertheless, they lacked information about how family members provide support in regard to self-management behaviors (Pamungkas, Chamroonsawasdi, \\& Vatanasomboon, 2017). As is well acknowledged, individuals' adherence along with family engagement to prescribed diabetes treatment is crucial to reach metabolic control lowering the complexities of diabetes, respectively. Family involvement in diabetes care may prevent patients from further complexities of diabetes (Isworo, Ekowati, Iskandar, \\& Latifah, 2018). Also, family members need to be informed in term of screening to prevent future complexities on individuals having diabetes, particular to those who have a sedentary lifestyle, a lack of physical activity, and an unhealthy diet (Soewondo, Ferrario, \\& Tahapary, 2013).\n\nManaging individual with diabetes along with diabetic foot ulcers in the context of family management has been done by some researchers in Indonesia (Rahayu et al., 2014; Yusra, 2011; Prantika, Susilo, \\& Bagus, 2014; Putri et al., 2013; Sari, Susanti, \\& Sukmawati, 2014; Laily, 2016). As is culturally known in Indonesia, patients suffering diabetes live with their family which may either provide practical help in the management of diabetes or they were unsure to their abilities to help their family member particular in accidental situations. How family members respond will be different based upon their individual personalities, how committed they are to the individual with diabetes and their sense of responsibility (Budianto, 2015). Moreover, their reactions could indicate insufficient knowledge, fear, worried, or even a desire to support some help. For these reasons, addressing family engagement for those with diabetes is imperative since this is the context in which the majority of diabetes management happens. Family members play an essential role in a patient's disease management, incorporating them in self-care interventions may possibly render significant changes in patients' outcomes such as self-efficacy, perceived social support, diabetes knowledge, and diabetes self-care (Pamungkas, Chamroonsawasdi, \\& Vatanasomboon, 2017; Baig, Benitez, Quinn, \\& Burnet, 2015).\n\nIn Indonesia context, a study described that implementing a family management program (health education, motivational program, follow up care) during three months improved patients' quality of life and self-care (Rahayu et al., 2014; Yusra, 2011). The family management program is linked with the improvement of blood glucose control (Prantika, Susilo, \\& Bagus, 2014; Putri et al., 2013). Incorporating family members are helpful in diabetes therapy (Sari, Susanti, \\& Sukmawati, 2014). What's more, family dynamics have been indicated to have an impact on diabetes management in adults. Overall evidence above proofs a beneficial effect of a family role for people living with diabetes. However, partnership amid patients and their families in those study is lacking and the majority of individuals had insufficient knowledge in association with diabetic foot care which this condition may potentially increase the risk of LEA (Laily, 2016). Accordingly, family involvement in diabetes care is required to give the advantages to the individual outcomes such as patients' well-being, physical activities, medication adherence, routine blood glucose control, routine foot care and ability to maintain the changes to a healthier lifestyle. Also, intensive health education with respect to foot care strategies should be emphasized within the individuals and their families in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2015, PERKENI (Persatuan Endokrinologi Indonesia) or the Indonesian Society for Endocrinology, officially issued a national guideline of diabetes management entitled \"konsensus pengelolaan dan pencegahan diabetes mellitus tipe 2 di Indonesia 2015\" or consensus on management and prevention of type 2 diabetes in Indonesia 2015 (Persatuan Endokrinologi Indonesia, 2015). In this guideline, several approaches were recommended such as assessing illness trajectory, performing a physical examination, doing laboratory test (HbA1c only), implementing health education in lifestyle changing (diet and physical activities only), and using appropriate medication. Nevertheless, we have identified limitation to the guideline as follows: they have not specifically described the role of family involvement in the therapy. It stands to reason that family role is fundamental aspect due to their responsibility to address individuals' non-adherence to treatment at home. Also, several studies support that non-adherence to the diabetes treatment regimen is possibly the most common reason for poor health outcomes among individuals with diabetes in Indonesia (Putri, Yudianto, Kurniawan, \\& Titis, 2013; Waluya, 2008; Windasari, 2014). For that reason, the need to improve the guideline is essential as it would enhance the role of a family member in diabetes therapy along with preventing the further complications of DFU. Moreover, family-based interventions for individuals having diabetes have therefore proven to be an effective approach in improving treatment outcomes (Sanjari, Peyrovi, \\& Mehrdad, 2016). Another limitation discovered that guideline has not included wound size as a biomarker of evaluation in a given treatment. This marker is important to evaluate the progress of the DFU treatment (Roth-Albin et al., 2017; Alexiadou \\& Doupis, 2012).\n\nAccordingly, DFU is currently being a critical problems needs to be solved in Indonesia. Ensuring the engagement of both the patients and their families in treatment is an important strategy to deal with the chronic conditions (Baig, Benitez, Quinn, \\& Burnet, 2015; Miller \\& DiMatteo, 2013; Pamungkas, Chamroonsawasdi, \\& Vatanasomboon, 2017). Therefore, conducting a comprehensive intervention of DFU partnering individuals and their families in association with self-and family management is a groundbreaking and challenging strategy to overcome problems on DFU. We believe the findings of our study will render significant contributions to the national guideline of diabetes in Indonesia and prevention of LEA in nursing practice. Furthermore, it will be able to give promising results for accelerating DFU healing.\n\nStudy objective:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a self- and family management of DFU programs on health outcomes as follows: behaviors (adherence to physical activities, medications, diet, foot care, and blood glucose control), family supports, biomarkers (HbA1c, wound size) in patients suffering DFU in Indonesia.\n\nStudy hypothesis:\n\nThe study participants who joined completely the self- and family management of diabetic foot ulcer programs during three months would have a better behavior, biomarkers, and family supports than those who received the usual care.\n\nStudy design:\n\nA prospective, randomized controlled trial study proposes to investigate the effect of self- and family management of diabetic foot ulcers programs on health outcomes among individuals with diabetic foot ulcers in Indonesia. The self-and family management of DFU program was designed and adapted based upon a review of the literature along with Indonesia guideline of diabetes management developed by the Indonesian Society for Endocrinology (PERKENI). This study will be conducted during three months and data will be collected four times in the study implementation. HbA1c and wound size have been considered as the distal outcomes in this study. On the other hand, individual and family behavior known as the proximal outcomes will also be evaluated as the mediator of the distal outcomes.\n\nThe study will be put into operation in four phases, as follows: 1) pre-implementation program (O1, 05) consist of measuring several variables as baseline data: individual baseline data (behavior: adherence to physical activity, diet for diabetic patients, blood glucose control, and foot care; biomarkers: HbA1c and wound size); and family baseline data (family supports). 2) Implementing the program phase 1 and measuring individual and family behavior, wound size (X1). 3) Implementing the program phase 1 and measuring individual and family behavior, wound size (X2). 4) Implementing the program phase 1 and measuring individual and family behavior, and biomarkers (HbA1c and wound size) (X3). The study process was depicted in the chart below.\n\nProgram implementation:\n\nResearcher preparation: prior to implementing the program, the researcher will prepare several elements such as participants characteristics obtained from selected wound care clinics. The procedure the usual care will also be assessed in this stage encompassing physical activity, medication, diet, foot care (i.e. wound care), and blood glucose control. Family management relating to DFU care will be collected from those clinics.\n\nProgram planning:\n\nThe self- and family management program of DFU was developed based upon the revised framework of self- and family management (Grey et al., 2015) and Konsensus Tatalaksana Diabetes Mellitus PERKENI Indonesia (2015). Additionally, the researcher added a literature review to improve the content of the guideline. In this study, the program will have two main outcomes consist of proximal outcome (family support and individual behavior) and distal outcomes (HbA1c and wound size). In this phase, the researcher will prepare the program-supported tools such as guideline from PERKENI and guideline developed by the researcher.\n\nSelf-management of DFU programs:\n\nThe self-management program will be implemented in one session within fifty minutes each session per week. However, it could be longer than as planned due to the atmosphere of discussion that possibly might change the duration. A total of 12 sessions was planned for program implementation. Teaching, group discussing, and counseling is the method that will be used during the study. On the following description, the contents of the self-management of DFU programs are presented.\n\nPhysical activities are critical for blood glucose management and overall health in individuals having diabetes. This includes all movement that increases energy use, whereas exercise is planned, structured physical activity. Regular physical activity may improve blood glucose control and reduces or prevent further complexities such as lower extremity amputations. In this session, participants will receive counseling, discussion, demonstration, and materials from the researcher. This material including the importance of performing physical activity according to the specific need of each individual with DFU. For instance, performing aerobic exercise (walking), weight training. Also, monitoring blood glucose before, during and many hours after activities to see how it effects on blood glucose levels.\n\nMedication in diabetes refers to achieving optimal medication-taking behavior which is a collaborative process of communication and understanding between participants and the researcher. The objective of this phase is to improve medication-taking behavior in participants by modifying their approach on an individual such as discussion, assessment of the barrier to adhere to medications. Participants will be encouraged to taken multiple medications for hyperglycemia, diabetes-associated conditions, and other comorbidities. This approach associates with improved outcomes, including reduced complexities of DFU, re-admission to hospital, and fatality.\n\nDiet goals for those suffering diabetes is to promote and support healthful eating patterns of diabetes, attain individualized glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid goals, achieve and maintain body weight goals, delay or prevent complications of diabetes, address individual nutrition needs based on personal and cultural preferences, maintain the pleasure of eating by providing positive messages about food choices, and provide the individual with diabetes with practical tools for day-to-day meal planning. In these sessions, the participant will be provided a discussion and counseling relating strategies to manage diet on diabetes and overcome the barrier that may interfere with the wound healing process.\n\nFoot care (i.e. wound care) refers to regular to protect the foot from nerve damage, circulation problems, and infections that lead to serious diabetic foot problems. Preventing diabetes complications, possessing the risk factors, and having the ability to manage complications is part of a DFU self-management program. In this stage, the study participant will be encouraged to pay much attention to checking feet regularly, inspecting inside the shoes daily from foreign objects, keeping the feet clean and using moisturizer, cut nails regularly, and changing the wound dressing. Discussion and demonstration to perform wound care will also be conducted in this study.\n\nBlood glucose control in this study refers to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) which is a crucial approach of diabetes therapy. SMBG has been recommended to attain a specific level of glycemic control and prevent acute hypoglycemia. The main goal of this phase is to collect detailed information about blood glucose levels at many time points to enable maintenance of a more constant glucose level by more precise regimens. Moreover, it can be used to aid in the adjustment of a therapeutic regimen in response to blood glucose values and to help individuals adjust their dietary intake, physical activity, and insulin doses to improve glycemic control on a day-to-day basis. Regular monitoring also enables tighter blood glucose control that diminish the long-term risks of diabetic complications. In Indonesia context, SMBG is the main concern of the individuals having diabetes that need to be improved by implementing this present study.\n\nFamily management of DFU programs:\n\nFamily management in this study focuses on three elements as follows the problem-solving discussion, establishing family roles in DFU care and effective involvement during DFU care. Family members come forward with understanding to deal with the condition alleviating the treatment burden as much as possible. For illustrative purposes, an individual having DFU always finds a family member for regular dressing and helping hand to handle daily activities. A family having patients with DFU should redistribute the roles of their members and show sensibility by managing inner conflicts, motivating the persons to adhere to treatment as per rule, and helping to nullify the worst impact of DFU. Motivational interviews, which can help to identify and reinforce the behavior change can be used to enhance the patient's motivation for diabetes self-care."

The PEDIS system will be used as a recommended classification (Game, 2016). This classification assesses perfusion (ischemia), extent (area), depth, infection, sensation (neuropathy). Individuals who have scored at \\< 7 is categorized at the low risk of the non-healing wound. Those who have \\> 7 are categorized at the high risk of a non-healing wound, amputation, and death (Chuan, Tang, Jiang, Zhou, \\& He, 2015).

                "briefSummary": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver conditions ranging from liver steatosis (NAFL), steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced liver fibrosis and ultimately leads to cirrhosis in a significant proportion of individuals. NAFLD is intimately associated with insulin resistance and associated disorders, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia.\n\nIt has been noted that several individuals with liver transplantation develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the transplanted liver. This is because of the presence of various risk factors of obesity and NAFLD, such as decreased physical activity, that persist following liver transplantation. Post-liver transplant patients are particularly at risk for developing NAFLD, as these patients are on oral steroids and immunosuppressants for a significant period of time.\n\nThere is no medication approved for the prevention or treatment of NAFLD. Semaglutide is an GLP-1 receptor agonist that have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Semaglutide has also been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on NAFLD. However, there is no data on the effect of semaglutide on liver fat accumulation or changes in body composition in patients following liver transplantation. Therefore, the current pilot study is planned to evaluate the effect of oral semaglutide on the liver fat, liver enzymes and body composition in patients undergoing liver transplantation",
                "detailedDescription": "This trial is an investigator initiated, open label, case-control study to examine the effect of oral semaglutide (3mg for 4 weeks; then 7 mg for 20 weeks) once a day for 24 weeks on liver and pancreatic fat content and body composition. Age- and BMI-matched controls will be recruited, who will receive standard care, except for oral semaglutide. Hepatic and pancreatic steatosis will be measured by MRI-proton-density fat fraction (PDFF), a validated quantitative biomarker for liver fat. Body composition parameters will be quantified by DEXA, the gold standard for body composition analysis. The study will be conducted according to the CONSORT guidelines. The patient population for the trial will be derived from Medanta-The Medicity Hospital endocrine and hepatology out-patient clinic, who would primarily visit for management of post-liver transplantation care and diabetes mellitus. The study will be conducted in Medanta-The Medicity Hospital, Gurugram, Haryana, which is a tertiary care center in North India. Patients deemed eligible will be screened for the trial\n\nStudy visits\n\nAfter careful assessment at the baseline visit, participants meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive oral semaglutide 3 mg once daily empty stomach for 4 weeks, then 7 mg for 20 weeks. Age- and BMI-matched controls will receive standard of care, except for oral semaglutide. Participants will be advised to return to the out-patient endocrine and hepatology/liver transplant clinics for follow-up visits at weeks 12 and 24.\n\nMRI-PDFF protocols\n\nMRI-PDFF for fat quantification\n\nMRI-PDFF is a non-invasive, objective, and quantitative MR imaging-based biomarker that can accurately estimate liver fat. MRI-PDFF has been demonstrated to be a robust technique for assessing treatment response in NASH clinical trials. In this study, the time interval from obtaining the baseline MRI-PDFF to initiating the study drug will be less than one week.\n\nMRI-PDFF for detailed fat mapping of the entire liver\n\nAll MR examinations will be done by an experienced MR technologist in the Medanta Radiology department under the direction of the radiologist investigator (SK). The radiologist investigator, blinded to the patients' treatment group allocation, clinical and biochemical data, and order of scans (baseline and follow-up), will perform the image analyses.\n\nROI colocalization before and after treatment To assess longitudinal changes in liver fat content, one colocalized ROI will be placed in each of the nine liver segments (nine separate ROIs) on the baseline and follow-up MRI examinations.\n\nSample size calculation We assumed that a 5.0% change in absolute liver fat content between baseline and 24 weeks would be the minimally appreciable and clinically relevant difference. We will recruit 30 patients on a pilot study basis. We will also recruit 20 age- and BMI-matched controls.\n\nPatient confidentiality Precautions will be taken to ensure confidentiality. Data collection forms will not reveal the name of patients included in study. All the participants will be covered by insurance to cover the cost of any untoward effect directly resulting from enrolment in the study."

Maintaining a constant blood glucose level of between 0.7 and 1.80 g/l is the day-to-day objective of diabetic patients.Insulin can be administered by injection via syringes or pens, or by insulin pumps and patients can perform self-monitoring of blood glucose.\n\nAll these actions can be the subject of therapeutic education, which involves a range of tools, including dedicated individual consultations carried out by state-qualified nurses.\n\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the benefit of therapeutic education consultations conducted by nurses in addition to medical consultations, on the follow-up of diabetic patients, insulin pump carriers or treated with multiple injections, in terms of glycemic control, quality of life and medical complications. The objective of the study is to evaluate whether the therapeutic education consultations conducted by nurses can improve the care of the diabetic patient."

However, there is a select group of patients that have low average glucose levels but high HbA1c levels. The investigators believe that these patients are fast glycators meaning that they incorporate sugar into their hemoglobin faster than normal. The investigators want to determine whether these patients are fast glycators."

All patients were divided into the SGLT-2 inhibitors group and other oral hypoglycemic agents group according to whether they were discharged with SGLT-2 inhibitors or not. The primary endpoint is adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and unplanned coronary revascularization at 12 months after the index PCI. The key secondary endpoints are changes in insulin resistance index and platelet reactivity at 3 months and change in glucose and lipid metabolism at 12 months after the index PCI."

All participating pharmacists who will play an active role in participant enrollment and the follow-up visits will be required to complete a participation consent form and 2 surveys. The first (Pre-study survey) should be completed after they have been fully trained on the study protocol and their study obligations, and before commencement of study enrollment. The second (Post-study survey) should be completed after the last patient has completed the 30-day follow-up visit. (Refer to Section 11 for the Study Flow).\n\nRandomization Process Participating pharmacists will dispense one of the two study pen needles according to a computer-generated list that will be provided to the participating pharmacy upon site activation"

In this study, the CGM sensor will be tested in an inpatient setting (meal/insulin test with frequent plasma glucose monitoring) at different days of wear-time. Sensor data will be compared to gold standard reference (Super GL2 analyser or YSI) and stability of sensor performance will be assessed over time. Additionally, safety and tolerability of the sensor will be investigated by regular assessment of the insertion site."

                "briefSummary": "The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in the world is currently around 9.3% of adults aged between 20 and 79 years, which corresponds to 463 million people living with DM, and about 80% of these people are found in developing countries. In Brazil, fourth in the number of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) in the world, the prevalence of DM is around 12%, with a significant increase in the last three decades. Non-adherence to DM treatment is known as a problem in the scenario and internationally, as it impairs the physiological response to the disease, increasing the direct and indirect cost of treatment. Pharmaceutical care is a practice model characterized by the provision of pharmaceutical services that optimize treatment, improve the process of medicines used, and aim at their best use. With the calamity situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic created in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the Pharmaceutical Telecare service was implemented. Dapagliflozin was recently incorporated into the Brazilian public system for the treatment of type 2 DM. Considering that there are no studies in Brazil to date on the use, treatment adherence, and problems related to pharmacotherapy (PRM) associated with dapagliflozin, and also considering that the guidance and monitoring of patients remotely have become more frequent and necessary, the purpose of this protocol is to describe a clinical trial that will evaluate the impact of a pharmaceutical telecare service in aspects related to treatment adherence, disease control, and costs, offered to people with DM2 using dapagliflozin. The hypothesis that will be tested is that Pharmaceutical Telecare can be as effective as standard care for type 2 diabetes and assess the associated costs related to teleconsultation in public health settings."

Our primary objective will be to determine the effects of CGM vs. usual care on glycemic control, defined by percent (%) of time in target glucose range (70-180 mg/dl). Our main and exploratory secondary objectives will be to determine the effects of CGM on CGM-indices of hypoglycemia, blood-based glycemic markers (HbA1c, glycated albumin, fructosamine), and patient-reported outcomes (health-related quality of life, diabetes distress, hypoglycemia fear). We will also evaluate feasibility endpoints by measuring CGM compliance during the intervention period and success/ease of implementing CGM training sessions among patients."

The volunteers were recruited between 2016 and 2020 through radio, newspaper, television and social media advertisements. A total of 1046 participants were enrolled into the study so far.\n\nAll participants were firstly invited to an interview with the physician-researcher for medical story register and physical examination. Afterwards, all participants were submitted to the following procedures: blood and urine samples collection, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 6 minutes walk test, hand strength test, bone densitometry test, diabetic polyneuropathy evaluation, advanced glycation end-product measurement, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, carotid doppler ultrasound, flow-mediated dilation, diabetic retinopathy assessment, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiac computed tomography for calcium scoring. After full examination, patients were contacted every year for 5 years for endpoints registration. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and myocardial revascularization. Secondary endpoints were end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis and limb amputation. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools."

                "briefSummary": "Approximately 2 billion people worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), with 90% of individuals having latent infection (LTBI). The control of TB requires clearly delineated helper T cell (Th) 1 responses and, to a lesser extent, Th17 responses, which both play important roles in the induction and maintenance of protective immune responses in mouse models of TB infection and in the prevention of active disease, as seen in LTBI. During latency, M. tuberculosis is contained in localized granulomas. Mycobacteria specific T cells mediate delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to purified protein derivative (PPD), and this reaction is generally considered to indicate an LTBI status in the absence of demonstrable active infection.\n\nAmong the various risk factors that are known to play a role in promoting active TB, HIV is the most well studied and described. However, in low-HIV-endemic countries like India, other risk factors might play a more prominent role in active TB pathogenesis. These include malnutrition, diabetes mellitus (DM), and helminth infections. LTBI individuals with these comorbidities or coinfections could be at a higher risk for developing active TB than their \"healthy\" LTBI counterparts without these comorbidities. Thus, it is imperative to study the pathogenesis of TB infection and disease in these \"at risk\" populations.\n\nIn this study, we will estimate the prevalence of severe to moderate malnutrition, uncontrolled DM, and helminth infections in LTBI-positive individuals. We will collect samples from a cohort of individuals with LTBI, those with LTBI and coexistent malnutrition, DM, or helminth coinfection, and those without any of these conditions. Individual participation may last up to 6 months. The main objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition, DM, and helminth infections in LTBI individuals.\n\nSimultaneously, we will perform transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic assays, including profiles in serum and urine, to determine the biosignature portfolio of these individuals. In addition, immunological assays examining cytokine/chemokine signatures as well as other immune parameters related to innate and adaptive responses will be performed to enhance the understanding of the immunological cross talk between LTBI and malnutrition, DM, and helminth infections.",
                "detailedDescription": "Study Design: This is a cross-sectional study to identify individuals with LTBI and coinfections/comorbidities: malnutrition; DM; and helminth infections. Individuals will first be evaluated clinically for symptoms of active TB. Individuals with symptoms of active TB will be excluded from the study and referred for treatment. Individuals who are asymptomatic for active TB will be screened for LTBI by interferon gamma (IFNγ) release assay (IGRA) and clinically assessed for malnutrition (by body mass index \\[BMI\\]), evaluated for DM status (by hemoglobin A1c \\[HbA1c\\] levels), and evaluated for helminth infection (by serology and stool quantitative polymerase chain reaction \\[qPCR\\]).\n\nIndividuals who are eligible will be assigned to one of six study groups based on LTBI status and presence of coinfections/comorbidities. Participants will have an additional study visit within 6 months of screening for clinical assessment and provide blood (30 ml), urine, and stool samples for experimental studies and storage for future research. Key research evaluations will include gene expression analyses and immunophenotyping on blood samples.\n\nSample Size:\n\nPrimary Objective: N=5000\n\nSecondary Objective: N=300; n=50 for each of the following groups:\n\n1. Latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) and malnourished;\n2. LTBI with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM);\n3. LTBI with helminth infection;\n4. LTBI with multiple comorbidities;\n5. LTBI with no comorbidities (LTBI+ healthy controls); and\n6. LTBI negative healthy controls\n\nStudy Population: Adults and adolescents (14-65 years of age) with or without LTBI.\n\nPrimary Objective: To estimate the prevalence of malnutrition, DM and helminth infections in LTBI individuals.\n\nSecondary Objective: To determine the effect of coinfections/comorbidities on biosignatures of LTBI using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), proteomics, metabolomics, and immunological assays.\n\nEndpoints: Prevalence of malnutrition, DM and helminth infections in LTBI individuals and their effects on biosignatures.\n\nEnrollment will continue until both the total screening sample and the 6 study groups are fully enrolled. We will increase the screening sample size to 6000 if the required study group sample sizes are not achieved by screening 5000 participants.\n\nRecruitment Plan: The screening phase of this study will be a community-based study in South India. Participants will be recruited from villages in the Kancheepuram District, where approximately 50% of the adult population tests positive for LTBI by IGRA based on our previous study (unpublished data). We also anticipate based on our previous study that the percentage of the adult population positive for malnutrition is 35%, for DM is 20%, and for helminth infection is 20% (unpublished data).\n\nThe census in villages in the Kancheepuram District is updated annually by local health workers employed by the Department of Public Health and the field teams of the NIRT in Chennai, India. The villages will be chosen in consultation with the Department of Public Health in Tamil Nadu. NIRT field teams will distribute pamphlets about the study to spread awareness. The pamphlet will be approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) prior to use.\n\nClinical Evaluations:\n\nPhysical examination and history: Review of medical history and regular physical examination (including height, weight, vital signs) will be performed at the screening phase.\n\nDuring the study phase, a complete medical history will be taken, as well as a regular physical exam with vital signs and anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, BMI Z scores, weight for height Z scores, mid upper arm circumference, waist and abdominal circumference, ratio of waist/hip circumference, skinfold thickness, and grip strength, and bioelectrical impedance analysis. For the bioelectrical impedance analysis, a multifrequency body composition analyser (Bodystat Quadscan 4000) will be used to derive body composition data. The measurements will be taken with light clothing and according to standard recommendations for conduct of bioelectrical impedance measurement (e.g., consistent time of the day, voiding urine before measurement, avoiding measurements soon after a major meal or exercise). The body composition data derived from the source data will be body fat mass, fat free mass, and body cell mass. The visceral adiposity index will be calculated based on sex, BMI, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Additionally, questionnaires for smoking and drug and alcohol use, including estimating Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) scores, will also be administered.\n\nBlood draw: A total of 10 ml of blood will be initially collected from each participant via venipuncture in the screening phase. The study phase will involve an additional 30 ml blood draw. Blood will be used for laboratory evaluations.\n\nUrine collection: Urine samples will be collected and stored and evaluated.\n\nStool collection: Stool samples will be collected in specialized containers and will be used for DNA extraction and storage.\n\nAt-home stool/urine collection: Participants who cannot provide urine and/or stool at a study visit may provide it within 3 days. The study team will provide instructions for the collection and storage of the samples.\n\nLaboratory Evaluations:\n\nBlood collected at the screening phase will be used for the following evaluations.\n\n1. Hematology: Complete blood count with differential and hematocrit levels. 2. IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Plus Gold In-Tube; Qiagen) to confirm LTBI status. 3. Biochemistry: HbA1c, random blood glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), urea, and creatinine.\n\n4. ELISA to identify and quantify infection with Wuchereria bancrofti. 5. Storage for future research. Blood collected in the study phase will be used for the following evaluations.\n\n1. Fasting glucose, HbA1c, and other biochemical parameters.\n2. Macro- and micronutrient levels, including serum albumin, C-reactive protein, cholesterol (total, HDL, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides), vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E, selenium, and zinc.\n3. For LTBI-negative individuals, repeat IGRA to confirm LTBI status. If the test is positive, the remaining blood will be discarded and the individual will be withdrawn from the LTBI negative cohort.\n4. Tempus or PAXgene tube blood collection for DNA and RNA isolation for experimental studies and storage for future research. No human genetic testing will be performed under this protocol.\n5. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation for experimental studies and storage for future research.\n6. Serum will also be collected for experimental studies and storage for future research.\n\nStool samples will be used for the following evaluations.\n\n1. At screening, stool DNA for qPCR diagnostics to detect hookworms, Ascaris, Strongyloides, and Trichuris.\n2. Storage for future research.\n\nAdditionally, urine samples collected in the study phase will be used for the following evaluations.\n\n1. Proteomic and metabolomic investigations.\n2. Storage for future research.\n\nResults of clinical evaluations will be returned to participants.\n\nExperimental Studies:\n\nTranscriptomics: We will perform RNA seq analysis on 50 individuals in each group to examine the transcriptomic signature. RNA will be extracted from Tempus or PAXgene tubes, coded, and analyzed by RNA seq. The data obtained will then be evaluated for RNA expression patterns and alterations.\n\nProteomics: Blood and urine proteomics is quickly becoming a major tool in advancing biomarker discovery, validation, diagnostics, and other fields. We will use serum and urine proteomics from a subset of individuals (n=30) in each group to perform proteomics by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analysis of protein expression in these groups would provide useful information on the protein signatures of LTBI in high risk populations.\n\nMetabolomics: We will use non-targeted capillary electrophoresis time of flight mass spectrometry to analyze the serum metabolic profiles of a subset of individuals (n=30) in each group. Metabolomics will complement the data obtained from proteomics.\n\nImmunological assays:\n\n1. Define circulating immune cell population frequencies by flow cytometry Our standardized flow cytometry panels, described below, will be applied to a subset of individuals (n=30) in each group (Table 1). We will measure frequencies of all major immune cell subsets: monocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T cells, including CD56+ T cells. T cells will further be divided into conventional T cells (CD4- and CD8 expressing cells) and non conventional T cells (mucosal associated invariant T cells, NK T cells, and gamma delta T cells). For conventional T cells, we will also capture memory phenotype and, for CD4+ T cells, the Th subsets. We will perform quality control using repeat runs of samples from a control donation to validate sample integrity and control for the sometimes drastic technical variability observed in cytometry experiments. To minimize technical variability, we will apply a centralized gating method where all results will be analysed by the same individual.\n2. Define the immune signatures of PBMCs and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells Cells will be sorted on a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) Aria cytometer from a subset of individuals (n=20) in each group. A minimum of 50,000 cells each of PBMCs and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be sorted into TRIzol LS. Based on our experience, at least 7% of PBMCs are memory CD4+ T cells and 4% are memory CD8+ T cells. Gene expression profiles of whole PBMCs and sorted memory T cells will be obtained by RNA-seq using the genome wide expression platform from Illumina, providing the expression levels for \\>50,000 identified genes in the human genome (including non-protein coding RNA species). Sample generation, library preparation, sequencing, and mapping will be performed under well-defined and standardized protocols, with quality control checks included at each major step to ensure high quality data generation. For gene expression analysis, where a huge number of variables is tested simultaneously, we will use the DESeq Benjamini Hochberg corrected p-adjusted values of \\<0.05 to identify differentially expressed genes between groups. We will perform pathway analysis of genes significantly upregulated between the different comparisons and investigate the associated gene modules. For this purpose, we will use the web tool Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to determine which pathways are significantly represented. We plan to use the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to determine in more detail the directionality of the overrepresented functions and the common upstream regulators for the given set of genes. A complementary approach will follow a modular analysis that identifies clusters of genes that share a similar expression profile. In particular, we plan to use the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm. By simultaneously monitoring the PBMC immune cell composition, determining the overall PBMC gene expression, and determining the profile of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we can detect disease specific signatures in PBMCs in general and identify the contribution of T cell subsets to these dysregulations in particular.\n3. Define antigen-reactive cellular immune responses by flow cytometry Antigen reactive cellular immune responses will be measured in a subset of individuals (n=20) in each group. PBMCs will be stimulated with PPD and M. tuberculosis whole cell lysate for 24 hours and antigen stimulated cellular immune responses will be studied. We plan to examine a panel of activation markers (HLA-DR, CD38, OX-40 and CD153), cytokines (IL-2, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-17), and cytotoxic markers (perforin, granzyme B, granulysin, CD107a) on all major conventional and non-conventional T cell subsets and NK cells.\n\nReturn of Research Results The experimental studies are not expected to reveal individual clinical results or medically actionable incidental findings. Therefore, no research results will be returned to participants."

The participants will be designated to either Irrigation and suction arm by bilateral drain insertion or the control arm by randomization through the parallel assignment. The participants will be followed for the outcome for four days in the hospital and then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively. The primary outcome measure will be the SSI rate. Secondary outcomes will be signs of SSI, post-operative pain, other complications and patient satisfaction.",

In this study, we will recruit middle-aged and elderly diabetic women who have been assigned to open abdominal hysterectomy due to different gynaecological reasons. This cohort is at great risk of surgical site infection and other risk factors of SSI like hypertension, hepatitis and malignancy may coexist in these women. The study period will span to include three hundred participants as calculated according to sample size. The women will be divided into either an I\\&S group or a control group by a simple random number container method. The women in the I\\&S group will be inserted with bilateral drains during surgery in subcutaneous tissue after the closure of the rectus sheath and irrigated with saline followed by suction through syringe suction attached to the wound for rest of the day. The procedure will continue for three days. On the fourth day, drains are removed and stitches are removed on the fourth postoperative day. In the control group, the wound will be closed by interrupted stitches without the insertion of subcutaneous drains. The dressing will be done daily for seven days. patients with no symptoms and signs of SS will be sent home on the eighth postoperative day. The patients will be followed for symptoms of SSI, pain, readmission rate, and other complications at 4,8 and 12 weeks."

Among the complications of T2DM it has been showed a high prevalence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Even if hypogonadism is associated to a worse metabolic profile and cardiovascular risk, it is discussed whether and when to treat this potentially reversible form associated to diabetes. In fact, the pathogenic mechanism of this condition in diabetic patients is not fully understood, and its clinical correlates, including the prevalence of other possible associated hypothalamic-pituitary axes dysfunctioning, questioned. The aim of the present study is to assess with an observational, cross sectional study on a large series of type 2 diabetic patients, enrolled consecutively: all the suspected etiologies of this complication in one single evaluation (both acquired and genetic congenital predisposition), its clinical correlates and the real prevalence of the disease using the lastly validated criteria for late onset hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."

                "detailedDescription": "Between 3 - 20% of women develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy, a condition in which blood sugar control is poor and can have serious health effects for both mom and baby. Women with GDM are at elevated risk of developing dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy and type 2 diabetes later in life. GDM also puts the baby at an increased risk of excessive birth weight, low blood sugar at birth, and future risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe 2019 Canadian Guideline for Physical Activity throughout Pregnancy recommends that women be physically active for at least 150 minutes spread over at least 3 days each week. Managing high blood sugars with exercise improves outcomes for mom and baby; however, optimal timing of exercise has not been investigated.\n\nThe goal of this study is to determine if exercising after meals in shorter bouts is more effective at controlling post-meal blood sugars than exercising in larger amounts between meals.\n\nThis is a fully remote study; participants will receive all necessary equipment in the mail and all interactions with the researcher will be done via phone, video call and email.\n\nThe study will recruit 30 pregnant women diagnosed (or not) with diabetes (gestational, pre-, or type 2 diabetes mellitus) after 20 weeks' gestation to participate in this 2-week study. Following a 2 day baseline period, they will be randomly assigned to: 1) walk for 10 minutes after each meal (SHORT), or 2) walk for 30 minutes once per day at any time except in the hour after eating (LONG) for 5 days. Following a 2- day washout period, women will then complete the alternative exercise protocol for an additional 5 days. Women will wear a Continuous Glucose Monitor to track blood sugars, and an accelerometer to track activity patterns (e.g., compliance to the intervention) for seven consecutive days. The Investigators hypothesize that women who walk for 10 minutes after each meal will have a blunted rise in blood sugar following food intake, compared to the women in the 30- minute walking group. Findings from this novel study may help better treat GDM, improving lifelong health for moms and babies around the world."

                "briefSummary": "This study is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel series randomized trial aimed at verifying the effiicacy and safety of a local calcium-sulphate bio-absorbable antibiotic delivery (tobramicina+vancomicina) versus placebo (calcium-sulphate matrix without antibiotics) in patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis treated with surgical procedures.",
                "detailedDescription": "Osteomyelitis is a severe complication of diabetic foot ulcers, that can occur in nearly 20-60% of patients. Current treatments for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) include surgical procedures aimed at removing necrotic soft tissue, gengrene and infected bones and systemic antibiotic therapy for at least 4-6 weeks; however in some cases, prolonged antibiotic therapy is not unusual.\n\nAntibiotic therapy can be problematic for several reasons, such as the achievement of appropriate and stable therapeutic concentration at bone level, particularly due to the common presence of concomitant peripheral artery disease, and kidney impairment. In recent years, another important barrier to the treatment of DFO was the increasing incidence of resistant pathogens. On the other hand, surgical options are affected by several side effects, such as alterations of foot biomechanics possibly leading to new ulcers (the so called transfer ulcer), post-surgical infections, ecc. All these factors make the DFO treatment challenging, with a high risk of all-cause mortality and rate of patients requiring major amputations Local bio-absorbable antibiotic delivery can be a valid therapeutic option for DFO treatment. During the last 2 decades, biodegradable carriers have been developed: proteins (collagen, gelatin, thrombin etc.), synthetic polymers, grafts, and substitutes (calcium sulfate or phosphate).\n\nLocal antibiotic delivery system has been widely explored to increase the duration of local antibiotic delivery and bone penetration, achieving very high local therapeutical doses (about several times higher than that obtained with systemic antibiotic therapy) with reduced systemic toxicity. Another important advantage of this device is the possibility of using very effective, but highly toxic, antibiotic such as aminoglycosides, often not taken into account for systemic therapies.\n\nFinally, this device can be used as a bone substitute filling the dead space caused by bone resection, thus reducing the incidence of reinfection. Complications of calcium sulfate are negligible and include postoperative drainage and transient hypercalcemia.\n\nThere several observational studies and very few randomized trials performed on DFO exploring the efficacy of local bio-absorbable antibiotic delivery and none on Stimulan.\n\nThe present study is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel series randomized trial aimed at verifying the effiicacy and safety of a local calcium-sulphate bio-absorbable antibiotic delivery (either with tobramicina or vancomicina) versus placebo (calcium-sulphate matrix without antibiotics) in patients with DFO treated with surgical procedures."

This observational study integrates the concept of TCM diagnostic methods with modern tools aim to provide an objective view on the syndrome differentiation of diabetic and prediabetic patients in Singapore and hence provide a guideline in the treatment options targeted specifically at Singaporeans demographic.\n\nA total of 250 subjects with 50 allocated in each group will be recruited to ensure a sufficient sample size for statistical analysis of the diabetic and prediabetic syndrome differentiation. Subjects aged 21-65 years old, of either gender, with no limitations on race, and is diagnosed with either diabetes (FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, or 2hPG ≥ 11.1mmol) or prediabetes (IFG of FPG 6.1-6.9 mmol/L, and/or IGT with 2hPG of 7.8-11.0 mmol/L) will be included.\n\nSubjective and objective assessments through health evaluation, Physical Activity Questionnaire and Sugar Intake, Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire, radial pulse diagnosis and tongue diagnosis will be performed for each subject in a single visit. Statistical analysis of assessments will be conducted using unpaired t-test with significance level of p\\<0.05. Statistical software SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc.) will be used for the analysis.",

                "briefSummary": "The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of the Buyuan Zhixiao Formula in treating elderly patients with diabetes and multiple metabolic disorders exhibiting symptoms of renal deficiency and blood stasis. Furthermore, this study aims to intervene in high-risk factors to prevent arteriosclerosis and to investigate the clinical efficacy of the Buyuan Zhixiao Formula in the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairments.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. What are the clinical effects of Buyuan Zhixiao Formula, including lowering blood sugar, lowering blood pressure, lowering lipids, and treating obesity?\n2. Can Buyuan Zhixiao Formula improve cognitive impairment in diabetes? Researchers compared Buyuan Zhixiao Formula with a placebo (a drug that looks similar but contains only 10% of the active ingredients) to see if the drug Buyuan Zhixiao Formula can treat elderly people with diabetes and multiple metabolic disorders.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n1. Take the drug Bu Yuan Zhi XiaoFormula or placebo every day for 6 months；Follow-up for 6 months；\n2. Check fasting blood sugar and 2-hour postprandial blood sugar every month; check HbA1c, blood lipids, vascular function, and cognitive impairment serum markers every 3 months;\n3. Conduct scores on TCM symptoms, cognitive ability, nutritional status and other scales and adverse events;\n4. Urine and serum samples were collected before and after treatment;"

The second aim of this study was to explore the relationships between fear of falling, physical performance, and plantar stiffness in patients with diabetes.",
                "detailedDescription": "Chronic diabetes can lead to ulceration in the plantar region and may result in amputation. Diabetes-related foot ulcerations are one of the most challenging complications of diabetes mellitus. Myotonometry, a technique to measure dynamic stiffness is preferred due to its noninvasiveness, easy employability, and rapid investigation. In this study, an attempt has been made to analyze the changes in soft tissue biomechanical properties of the plantar surface in diabetes. Increased plantar tissue stiffness is thought to alter the distribution of tensile stresses in the plantar soft tissues during gait. Combined with a reduction in plantar tissue thickness, these changes could collectively decrease the mechanical loads required to initiate soft tissue breakdown and thus lead to foot ulceration formation. Diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for falls in adults and is associated with an increase in fear of falling. Microvascular complications associated with DM result in multiple impairments including sensory deficits and muscle weakness due to peripheral neuropathy, loss of visual acuity due to retinopathy, and impaired postural control and falls due to vestibulopathy. The prevalence of falls and fear of falling are significantly higher in adults with diabetes mellitus. Assessment of mechanical properties of plantar tissues can aid in the early diagnosis of ulceration. In this study, an attempt has been made to analyze the changes in soft tissue biomechanical properties of the plantar surface in diabetes. The second aim of this study was to explore the relationships between fear of falling, physical performance, and plantar stiffness in patients with diabetes."

In intervention group , All participants received Management mode of standardized diabetes mellitus health education.The standardized patient education included one-week personalized education on diabetes knowledge, diet and excise, glucose monitoring and hypoglycemia self-management and others during the hospitalization period. After discharge, patients were followed through the phone call at 2and 4 weeks. Follow-up of diabetic education outpatients at 12 and 24 weeks after discharge. The education nurse gave recommendations according to patent's problem during the follow-up. Full-time education nurses carry on education according to diabetes mellitus health education path table. In routine, After hospitalization, the responsible nurses interspersed with diabetes health education during the hospitalization. The health education is mainly about the problems observed by the responsible nurses and the problems raised by the patients. The patients were followed up by telephone 2 weeks after discharge."

                "detailedDescription": "Empagliflozin:\n\nGenerally, Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have important benefits for older people, such as a low risk of hypoglycemia, reduction of cardiovascular and renal risk, and an insulin-independent mechanism, allowing its use in disease of any duration. Advantages include lack of hypoglycemia as a side effect, and mild reduction in blood pressure and body weight.\n\nThe SGLT2i class is well-tolerated, though some caution is also suggested, including adjustment of concomitant therapies, such as insulin and antihypertensives, especially loop diuretics.\n\nThe 2022 latest guidelines by the American Diabetes Association recommend that if insulin is used in adults with type 2 diabetes, it is recommended that, for better efficacy and durability of treatment effect, combination therapy be employed using a glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor agonist and consideration may be given to combined therapy employing a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor and a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, both with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit, \"for additive reduction in the risk of adverse cardiovascular and kidney events\" in patients \"with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\". Moreover, among patients with type 2 diabetes who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucacon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefit are recommended as part of glycemic management. The same guidelines recommend that among patients with ASCVD in whom heart failure coexists or is of special concern, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended and patients who are unable to maintain glycemic targets on basal insulin in combination with oral medications can have treatment intensified with GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, or prandial insulin.\n\nConclusively, it is recommended that a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) with demonstrated cardiovascular disease benefit be administered to patients with type 2 diabetes who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), indicators of high ASCVD risk, established kidney disease, or heart failure.\n\nVITAMIN D3:\n\nThis section focuses on seven diseases, conditions, and interventions in which vitamin D might be involved: bone health and osteoporosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), depression, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 2 diabetes, and weight loss.\n\nAmong postmenopausal women and older men, many clinical trials have shown that supplements of both vitamin D and calcium result in small increases in bone mineral density throughout the skeleton. They also help reduce fracture rates in institutionalized older people.\n\nLaboratory and animal studies suggest that vitamin D might inhibit carcinogenesis and slow tumor progression by, for example, promoting cell differentiation and inhibiting metastasis. Vitamin D might also have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic effects. Observational studies and clinical trials provide mixed evidence on whether vitamin D intakes or serum levels affect cancer incidence, progression, or mortality risk.\n\nVitamin D helps regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (and thereby blood pressure), vascular cell growth, and inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with vascular dysfunction, arterial stiffening, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hyperlipidemia. For these reasons, vitamin D has been linked to heart health and risk of CVD.\n\nVitamin D is involved in various brain processes, and vitamin D receptors are present on neurons and glia in areas of the brain thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression.\n\nMany epidemiological and genetic studies have shown an association between Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and low 25(OH)D levels before and after the disease begins. Observational studies suggest that adequate vitamin D levels might reduce the risk of contracting MS and, once MS is present, decrease the risk of relapse and slow the disease's progression.\n\nVitamin D plays a role in glucose metabolism. It stimulates insulin secretion via the vitamin D receptor on pancreatic beta cells and reduces peripheral insulin resistance through vitamin D receptors in the muscles and liver. Vitamin D might be involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes through its effects on glucose metabolism and insulin signaling as well as its ability to reduce inflammation and improve pancreatic beta-cell function.\n\nLow vitamin D status appears to be associated with type 2 diabetes and most other insulin resistance disorders reported to date.In persons with prediabetes, vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of T2DM and increases the reversion rate of prediabetes to normoglycemia. The benefit of the prevention of T2DM could be limited to nonobese subjects.\n\nMoreover, Vitamin D, among many benefits, has positive outcomes on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control. It aids in insulin secretion and sensitivity. The clinical significance of Vitamin D administration in DM II from a glucose homeostasis perspective, and complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Vitamin D had a clinical positive impact on glucose level, particularly on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction, alleviation of diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy symptoms, and hyperglycemia induced oxidative stress on the retinal cells.\n\nObservational studies indicate that greater body weights are associated with lower vitamin D status, and obese individuals frequently have marginal or deficient circulating 25(OH)D levels.\n\nVITAMIN K2:\n\nType 2 diabetic patients are at high risk of bone fractures even if their bone mineral density is normal or high. This is likely explained by poor bone quality and extraskeletal factors. Vitamin K(2) stimulates γ-carboxylation of osteocalcin and can increase bone formation through steroid and xenobiotic receptors. study showed that vitamin K(2) administration in a type 2 diabetic had the following skeletal benefits: increased serum osteocalcin, improved collagen cross-link profiles, and increased bone strength. These new findings suggesting a possible beneficial effect of vitamin K(2) supplementation on bone quality in type 2 diabetes.\n\nMicronutrients are gaining acceptance as an important nutritional therapy for the prevention and/or management of diabetes and its associated health risks. Although a very small quantity of micronutrients are required for specific functions in our bodies, moderate deficiencies can lead to serious health issues. Impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance play a major role in the development of diabetic pathophysiology. Vitamin K is well known for its function in blood coagulation. Moreover, several human studies reported the beneficial role of vitamin K supplementation in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, preventing insulin resistance, and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2 D). Both animal and human studies have suggested that vitamin K-dependent protein (osteocalcin \\[OC\\]), regulation of adipokine levels, antiinflammatory properties, and lipid-lowering effects may mediate the beneficial function of vitamin K in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.\n\nStudies showed vitamin K2 intake reduced 7% T2DM risk with each 10-μg increment.\n\n* Vitamin K2 has a more significant effect than vitamin K1 on T2DM.\n* Vitamin K2 increased insulin sensitivity via osteocalcin metabolism.\n\n  . Vitamin K2 improved IR via anti-inflammatory property and lipid-lowering effects.\n* Vitamin K2 suppresses inflammation via inactivating NF-κB signalling pathway.\n* Vitamin K2 supplementation decreases fat accumulation and serum triglycerides.\n\nAn important strategy for controlling T2DM is the use of vitamin supplements. vitamin K supplementation can effectively improve clinical features of diabetes. Vitamin K has different forms, including vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), vitamin K2 (menaquinone or MK) and vitamin K3 (synthetic form named menadione). Differences in the chemical structure of K1 (phylloquinone) and K2 (menaquinone) have led to differences in their uptake and bioavailability. Adsorption, bioavailability and the half-life of K2 is higher than K1. Another study suggested that vitamin K supplementation in T2DM results in improved glycemic status, including: FBS, HbA1C, FI and HOMA-IR. Vitamin K supplementation may also help with body weight maintenance."

The investigators recruit patients with underlying T2DM mellitus who obtain medication at each district's primary Government Health Clinic.\n\nStudy Design: The study will be a prospective, multicenter and parallel-design single-blind randomised controlled with two treatment groups. The trial evaluates a PICC's effectiveness in improving HBA1C involving a four-session structured group-based intervention (SGBI) of a two to three-hour pharmacist-led program with follow-up evaluations. The control arm will be the Diabetes Mellitus Therapy Adherence Clinic (DMTAC). DMTAC is a gold standard for pharmacy-led DM education in Malaysia and an individualised-based program.\n\nGeneral Objective:\n\n1. To describe and critically appraise DM education studies in Malaysia.\n2. To examine the program's effectiveness versus control in improving medication adherence with underlying T2DM in the Sarawak State of Malaysia.\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\n1. To measure the effectiveness of PICC in improving HbA1C, fasting blood glucose and understanding\n2. To investigate the sustainability of the program.\n\nStudy endpoints/outcomes:\n\nPrimary outcome: laboratory-analysed HbA1C will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcome: Investigating knowledge and understanding of DM medication management will be evaluated using the quizzes in the PICC program.\n\nSample Size: A previous study has shown a standard deviation of 1.5. Suppose the actual difference between the experimental and control means is 1, 36 experimental and 36 control subjects with a probability (power) of 0.8. By estimating 30% dropout or incomplete data, a minimum sample size of 94 (47 for each group).\n\nStudy Duration: 1 October to 31 January 2022."

                "briefSummary": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) serves as a beneficial instrument during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, affording insight into lesion characteristics and stent implantation. The ULTIMATE trial recently evidenced that IVUS-guided Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) implantation notably ameliorated clinical outcomes in all-comers, especially in patients who underwent an optimal procedure defined by IVUS, as opposed to angiography guidance, resonating with findings from the IVUS-XPL study, OCTOBER trial, and RENOVATE COMPLEX PCI trial, further confirmed by more recent IVUS-ACS trial.\n\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) has a resolution 10 times higher than that of IVUS and can provide valuable information at each step of PCI.\n\nRegrettably, a dearth of prospective, randomized, multicenter trials exists that scrutinize the benefits of IVI-guided as opposed to angiography-guided PCI in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. However, several trials have presented subgroup analyses reporting the reduction of clinical events by IVUS but not OCT guidance in patients with diabetes mellitus, which served as the foundation for the design of this trial.",

The previously developed DNN score provides a promising avenue to detect diabetes in these high-risk communities by leveraging photoplethysmography (PPG) technology on the commercial smartphone camera that is highly accessible. Our primary aim is to prospectively clinically validate the PPG DNN algorithm against the reference standards of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) for the presence of prevalent diabetes. Our vision is that this clinical trial may ultimately support an application to the Food and Drug Administration so that it can be incorporated into guideline-based screening."

It may be due to impaired insulin secretion, resistance to peripheral actions of insulin, or both . Chronic hyperglycemia in synergy with the other metabolic aberrations in patients with diabetes mellitus can cause damage to various organ systems, leading to the development of disabling and life-threatening health complications, most prominent of which are microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications leading to a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular diseases Mg2+ deficiency is usually identified by the measurement of serum Mg2+ concentration. Hypomagnesemia is defined by a serum Mg2+ concentration \\< 0.75 mmol/L, but a deficiency due to low dietary intake in otherwise healthy people is uncommon. Although overt signs of clinical Mg2+ deficiency are not routinely recognized in the healthy population, relatively low Mg2+ intake and/or Mg2+ status have been shown to be associated with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, T2DM, osteoporosis, pulmonary disease, depression, migraine headaches, inflammation, and cancer"

For these patients, the endocrine function of the pancreas is a critical factor that influences quality of life. In this study, the investigators recruit patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy in Peking Union Medical College Hospital within the last 10 years. Demographic characteristics, operative parameters and short-term postoperative outcomes were collected in a prospective database maintained by the Pancreatic Surgical Centre, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. These patients are followed up regularly by outpatient visiting or telephone for long-term outcomes. The primary outcome of this study is new-onset diabetes mellitus; second outcomes include impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, exocrine insufficiency and disease recurrence. This study aim to determine the cumulative rates of endocrine insufficiency, and identify risk factors for DM development in a large cohort of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy."

The prevalence of diabetes in elderly patients is very high and is predicted to increase dramatically.\n\nPrior studies have generally been concerned with the inadequate treatment of diabetes however, over the last few years the overtreatment of diabetes has also come to the fore. Unfortunately, there are very few data worldwide and no data in Turkey about the overtreatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis study aimed to assess the rates and predictors of overtreatment and undertreatment of glycemia and blood pressure in older adults with T2DM. Treatment deintensification or intensification by the physicians were also investigated."

                "briefSummary": "Diabetes Mellitus is known to be a risk factor for difficult laryngoscopy. Several studies showed that diabetes mellitus is responsible for 30% of difficult laryngoscopy.Insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs are two main current medication prescribed for diabetes patients.Insulin is responsible for muscle hypertrophy and weigh gain.Oral antidiabetic drugs induces muscle atrophy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in the difficult laryngoscopy as a general anesthetic component in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) using either insulin or oral antidiabetic drug (OAD).",
                "detailedDescription": "DM is accepted as a risk factor for difficult intubation.OAD and insulin are two main pharmacological treatment component of DM.Insulin induces respiratory smooth muscle contraction.Otherwise, OAD drugs ca affect muscle atrophy in patients with type II DM patients.The use of these drugs may affect laryngoscopy during endotracheal intubation,which is a component of general anesthesia.Metformin causes muscle atrophy and weight loss.Some in vitro studies have shown an induction of cell apoptosis with therapeutic doses of sulfonylureas which can lead to atrophy.Glinides can cause atrophy in experimental animals.Hypoglycemia and weight gain are two important side effects of intensive insulin therapy.İnsulin is the major anabolic hormone in the body. Insulin binds to receptors on adipose tissues and potentiate inhibition of lypolysis and storage of triglycerids.And this cause obesity.This is one of the reasons that suggest the relationship between insulin and difficult airway.The effect of insulin on airway smooth muscle leads to increased airway contraction,cell proliferation,and the thicker,stiffer and more hypercontractile airway.In some studies,type II DM patients with duration of more than 5 years switched to insulin therapy and airway hypersensitivity was observed in the first three months.Insulin plays an anabolic role in skeletal muscle by enhancing amino acids transport in skeletal muscle and by increasing the rate of protein synthesis.İnsulin induces air way smooth muscle contraction through the production of contractile prostaglandins, which in turn are dependent on Rho-kinase for their contractile effects.Prostaglandins also stimulate IL-6 and MuRF-1 transcription in human skeletal muscles.Prostaglandin regulates skeletal muscle mass and function.Therefore,insulin may cause airway skeletal muscle contraction and may be the reason of difficult laryngoscopy.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in the difficult laryngoscopy as a general anesthetic component in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) using either insulin or oral antidiabetic drug (OAD).\n\nMETHODS After the approval of the local ethics committee of our hospital, a study was planned for a total of 230 patients including Type I and Type II DM patients and non-DM patients as a control group who would undergo elective surgery between 25.01.2020-30.04.2020.Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), Mallampati scores, thyromental distance (TMD), sternomental distance (SMD), inter-incisor distance (ID) and neck extension measurements were taken.Preoperative HbA1C levels, DM type, diagnosis time and duration of insulin or OAD use were recorded.Patients without DM, patients using insulin and patients using OAD were grouped as group C, group I and group D, respectively.DM patients were planned to be operated as first patient in the morning.50 mg of ranitidine,10 mg of metoclopramide and 1 gr of cefazolin for surgical prophylaxis were administered intravenously 30 minutes before anthesia induction.Patients were preoxygenated with 100% O2 for 3 minutes.As diabetes mellitus patients are under high risk of aspiration due to gastroparesis,we applied rapid sequence induction technique.1 mcg/kg fentanyl citrate,2 mg/kg propofol,1mg/kg rocuronium bromide were given intravenously according to patient's adjusted body weight.After low tidal volume ventilation with face mask,the trachea was intubated by using DL (Macintosh laryngoscope).During intubation, the following data were documented:Cormack-Lehane grade, number of laryngoscopic attempts, intubation time, intubation success at the first attempt, performance of backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) maneuver and requirement of use of different airway equipments were compared between the groups. Adverse events related to tracheal intubation were evaluated: desaturation (SPO2\\<94), hypercabia (ETCO2\\>35), hypertension (mean arterial pressure \\>20% above baseline values), tachycardia (heart rate \\>20% above baseline values), new onset arrhythmia, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, airway trauma and sore throat in PACU). The primary outcome measures are mallampati score,thyromental distance,Cormack-Lehane grade and the time to intubation,secondary outcome measures are first-attempt intubation success,number of laryngoscopic attempts,performance of backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) maneuver and requirement of use of different airway equipments."

In this study, participants will use both devices during meal tests and also at home during routine care. The results from the device will be compared to a standard reference method and will be used to determine the accuracy of the two device components.",
                "detailedDescription": "The trial starts with a screening and training visit (V1). This is followed by an individual calibration period for the non-invasive device component by means of multiple parallel measurements with the invasive and the noninvasive device component. This will be done by the participants at home. Thereafter, the participants will come to the study site and will ingest a standardized meal (V2). Blood will be drawn for assessment of HbA1c and biochemical safety parameters. During the next 3 hours, 11 fingersticks will be made to obtain capillary blood samples for comparator readings with the two CoG components and with a laboratory reference method (YSI gucose analyzer). The patients will now continue to use the devices at home for three months, but are not allowed to use any CoG result for treatment decisions. In an interim visit after 6 weeks (V3), blood will be drawrn for HbA1c and biochemical safety parameters and three comparison measurements will be made with the CoG device components and the laboratory reference method. At the final visit after 12 weeks (V4), the procedures of the first meal test visit (V2) will be repeated, which conludes that study. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a device satisfaction questionnaire at V2, V3, and V4."

The main causes for increase in incidence of DM are inactivity, obesity and changes of dietary habits. Investigators think that the changes in the awake-sleep cycle may also contribute to higher incidence of DM in recent years. Melatonin is an important component of the circadian system. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that melatonin has many beneficial actions.Melatonin is a potent antioxidant, reduces inflammatory process, lowers blood pressure, improve lipid profiles. Collectively, these data suggest that melatonin may be useful in control of blood sugar in patients with DM.\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of melatonin in control of blood sugar in patients with type 2 DM."

Viusid and Asbrip will be administered orally.\n\nA total of 60 subjects will be randomized 2: 1 in this study. 40 patients will be assigned to Viusid plus Asbrip plus standard of care and 20 control patients with standard of care.\n\nTreatment duration: 21 days.",
                "detailedDescription": "In December 2019, a group of \"pneumonia of unknown origin\" cases were reported in Wuhan, China. Only a few days later, Chinese health authorities confirmed that this group was associated with the coronavirus and that the disease caused by it was named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. Confirmed by comparative homology analysis, COVID-19 is closely associated with the bat-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (bat-SL-covzc45 and bat-SL-covzxc21, with 88% identity), but it is a far cry from coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (about 79%) and coronavirus from respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS-CoV) (about 50%). The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China reported a total of 77,658 confirmed cases, including 9,162 with serious illnesses and 2,663 deaths as of February 25, 2020.ç\n\nThe new pathogen β-coronavirus was initially named as the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but on January 12, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) named it coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological reports demonstrated high infectivity from person to person in social, family, and hospital settings. Given this rapid increase in new cases worldwide, the WHO declared a pandemic state 13 The results of a meta-analysis showed that the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86-97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI: 59-76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34-68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21-40%). Comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease. For the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, a suspected or probable case is defined as a case that meets: (1) three clinical criteria or (2) two clinical criteria and one epidemiological criterion. The clinical criteria are: fever; radiographic evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome; and low or normal white blood cell count or low lymphocyte count. Epidemiological criteria are: living in Wuhan or history of travel to Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; contact with patients with fever and symptoms of respiratory infection within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; and a link to confirmed cases or groups of suspected cases. Defining a confirmed case, for the first case in a province, is a suspected or probable case with detection of viral nucleic acid at city CDC and provincial CDC. For the second case and all subsequent cases, the definition is a suspected or probable case with detection of nucleic acid from the virus at CDC City. We defined the cases as symptomatic individuals, which could be detected by means of a control temperature across international borders, or who had a disease severity requiring hospital admission, or both, plus travel history to Wuhan. 14 In Ecuador in the city of Guayaquil, the Minister of Health, on February 29, 2020, confirmed the presence of the first \"imported\" case of Covid-19 in Ecuador. It was an Ecuadorian citizen who arrived from Spain on February 14 at the Guayaquil airport, who had no symptoms. Later days she presented discomfort and fever, reasons for which she was hospitalized and the respective tests were performed for Covid-19 disease, which was positive.\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the WHO, the world health organization, officially declares the pandemic caused by the SARS VOC-2 virus and in Ecuador the Emergency Operations Committee is activated, in relation to this committee the following is detailed. The Emergency Operations Committees are components of the Decentralized National Risk Management System, which are responsible for planning and maintaining joint coordination and operation between different levels and functions of the institutions involved in the response and attention to emergencies and disasters in a field territorial defined. On March 12, 2020 two new people tested positive. In total, 19 cases of COVID-19 are registered in Ecuador, the following day the first person died from the coronavirus (COVID-19) occurred in Ecuador. On March 31, 2020, there were 2,240 positive cases for COVID-19, 3,257 suspected, 2,485 discarded from a total of 7,982 samples, 75 confirmed deaths; 61 probable deceased and 54 with hospital discharge. At the beginning of April 2020, the Minister of Public Health, Juan Carlos Zevallos, in a virtual press conference, announced that 100,000 rapid tests and 100,000 PCRs arrived in our country that will serve to expedite the results of the exams for COVID-19.\n\nUntil the closing of this project, the records of the MSP indicated that on April 23, 2020, there were 11,183 confirmed cases and 560 people dead. The city of Guayaquil with a population of more than two million inhabitants with the increase in more positive and suspicious cases, became the epicenter of the pandemic at the national level, in this framework, the Teodoro Maldonado Carbo Specialty Hospital located at In the south of the city, it is a third level hospital, since the aforementioned health crisis began with a high influx of patients suspected of covid-19. Current treatment for COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. Ruan Q et al. Studied the predictors of mortality in a recent retrospective, multicenter study of 150 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, including elevated ferritin (mean 1297.6 ng / ml in non-survivors versus 614.0 ng / ml in survivors; p \\<0 · 001) and IL-6 (p \\<0 · 0001), suggesting that mortality could be due to viral hyperinflammation. There is an urgent need for effective treatment. The current focus has been on the development of new therapies, which include antivirals and vaccines. Accumulated evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may have cytokine storm syndrome.\n\nObjectives:\n\nDetermine the safety and efficacy of Viusid + Asbrip in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nKeep security through identification, proper and timely management of adverse events and evaluation of biochemical parameters.\n\nMeasure efficacy through clinical improvement: evaluation of radiological signs and blood analysis estableshed in this study."

                "briefSummary": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by absolute insulin deficiency, defined as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and develops due to autoimmune damage of beta cells in the pancreas. Approximately 425 million people worldwide are diabetic patients, 5% to 10% of whom are T1DM. In the majority of type 1 DM prevention studies, the main aim is to stop beta cell destruction. Primary prevention studies aim to prevent or alter exposure to environmental stimuli before autoimmunity is developed. Secondary prevention studies address interventions in the autoimmune processes that cause betacell destruction. Tertiary prevention studies include interventions to stop or reverse beta-cell destruction after clinical diagnosis of type 1 DM. Despite all technological advances, type1DM has not shown a permanent improvement in metabolic control over the last 5 years. Breast milk provides protection against Type 1 DM through the prevention of diabetogenic infections, delaying exposure to diet antigens including cow's milk, and the ability to produce healthy intestinal microbiota. Xiao et al. (2018) published in Nature, investigated the effect of human milk oligosaccharides on non-obese diabetic rats, where it was found that it improved intestinal flora and insulitis scores and brought the blood glucose level closer to the optimum level.\n\nThis study is expected to fill the gap in the literature about dose-dependent efficacy and placebo of breastmilk oligosaccharides in diabetic humans. This project will investigate 1) the possible contribution of 2-FL oligosaccharides to the disease's metabolic control 2) their effects on beta-cell preservation in the pancreas 3)their effects on intestinal microbiota 4) whether there is a doseresponse relationship as compared to placebo among type 1 diabetic children. This project is designed as a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled experiment lasting for 36 months. The proposed research population consists of 111 children aged 4-16-year-old who were diagnosed with Type 1 DM at the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology of Ege University. The sample size was calculated as 111 with an effect size of 0.33, an error of 0.05 and a power of 80% using the F-test group (for a numerical variable such as blood glucose) for 3 groups. It is planned that the two intervention arms consist of 37 volunteers and the placebo group of 37 volunteers. In the research, 1.5 g/day of human milk oligosaccharides will be supplemented in the first intervention group and 3 g/day for the second intervention group. The placebo group will receive maltodextrin as a placebo at a dose with no effect on metabolic control. Patients included in the study will be provided human milk oligosaccharides for 3 months and will be under follow-up for 12 months. All variables, mainly C-peptide, HbA1c, immunoglobulins, lymphocytes and faecal analysis will be examined. The project aims to ameliorate the microbiota profile, optimize C-peptide levels, reduce exogenous insulin dependence through the provision of 2-FL from human milk oligosaccharides and develop a more applicable, acceptable and an innovative method in the metabolic control of the disease. It is believed that the psychosocial and economic burdens of the disease will be reduced by increasing the metabolic control of the disease."

In this study, it is planned to supplement the diet of the placebo group with 1.5 g/day maltodextrins to approximately half of the diet and to supplement the other half with 3 g/day maltodextrins, after the group was randomized within itself. Effects of these doses on metabolic control are not expected. Maltodextrine is in powder form, its dosage of up to 3 g/day has a negligible effect on blood glucose, it has a neutral taste, it is cheap and easy to find, and it is safe and ineffective.",

                "briefSummary": "The main purpose of this study is to assess the impact of exercise training (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, combined aerobic and resistance exercise) versus a sedentary waiting list control on glycemic control (as reflected in reduced hemoglobin A1c \\[HbA1c\\]), body composition (weight, body mass index \\[BMI\\], waist circumference, total body fat, visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat, mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area), lipids (Apo-B, Apo-A1, Apo-B/A1 ratio, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle diameter, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and quality of life.",
                "detailedDescription": "Background. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Western world is rising rapidly due to increases in obesity and sedentary behaviour, and diabetes is among the most potent common risk factors for premature disability and mortality. Landmark clinical trials such as the UK Prospective Diabetes Study proved that these excess risks in type 2 diabetes can be reduced through relatively modest improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c difference of 0.9% over time). The excess morbidity and mortality in diabetes is attributable both to hyperglycemia and to a cluster of other metabolic disturbances associated with insulin resistance, and exercise can have beneficial effects on all of these abnormalities. The standard recommendation to people with diabetes has been to perform aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, swimming, or jogging. There is very little research on resistance exercise (such as weight lifting or exercise with weight machines) in type 2 diabetes. Resistance exercise in non-diabetic subjects increases lean body mass, resulting in increased metabolic rate, decreased insulin resistance and increased glucose disposal. Furthermore, in a recent randomized trial the addition of resistance exercise to a cardiac rehabilitation program resulted in marked improvements in quality of life, to a far greater extent than seen with aerobic exercise alone. For these reasons, we feel that resistance exercise in type 2 diabetes is a modality worthy of further research. A pilot study of our present proposal, funded by the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) is in progress; compliance has been excellent with \\>90% attendance.\n\nPrimary research question: In patients with type 2 diabetes, does a 6-month resistance or aerobic training program result in improved glycemic control as reflected in reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)? Is the effect of one type of exercise additive to that of the other?\n\nSecondary research questions: In patients with type 2 diabetes, what are the effects of each exercise modality on:\n\n1. Body composition (assessed using gold-standard methods including CT scan and deuterium oxide), resting energy expenditure (using indirect calorimetry) and insulin resistance? To what extent do changes in these parameters mediate changes in HbA1c?\n2. Important nontraditional metabolic CHD risk factors (LDL particle diameter, plasma insulin, apoprotein B, c-reactive protein, free fatty acids) and traditional metabolic CHD risk factors (HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, BP)?\n3. Health-related quality of life (QOL) as measured by the Well-Being questionnaire or the SF-36? Does modality of exercise or change in quality of life from baseline to 6 months predict frequency of exercise during the 6 months following the intervention?\n\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial. After a 4-week supervised low-intensity exercise run-in period to test compliance, previously inactive Type 2 diabetic subjects not currently engaging in regular exercise are randomized to 4 arms: aerobic exercise 3X per week, resistance exercise 3X per week, both combined or waiting-list control. The exercise intervention takes place at YMCA branches in metropolitan Ottawa. Exercise is closely supervised and progressive in intensity and duration. Compliance is verified through direct supervision, completion of detailed exercise logs, and central automated electronic tracking of YMCA attendance through scanning of membership cards. Primary outcomes are measured at 6 months. At the end of 6 months subjects are given a maintenance program and reexamined 6 months later to assess the durability of any benefits from the exercise program. During the 6 month intervention period diet is standardized using repeated sessions with a dietitian, and doses of medications altering glucose, lipids and BP are held constant unless change is medically urgent.\n\nSignificance: The global burden of type 2 diabetes is increasing, and complications of the illness occur primarily in those whose glycemic control is fair or poor. If appropriately selected exercise training improves glycemic control and is adopted by more patients, it is likely that the morbidity associated with type 2 diabetes will be decreased. This is particularly true if such training also improves quality of life, and more people are thus inclined to continue exercising in the long term."

Exercise intensity is standardized using Polar Heart rate monitors that display the subject's heart rate.\n\nResistance training:Exercises are performed at weight machines arranged in a circuit. Throughout the resistance training program, subjects will alternate between the exercises of group A and group B below.\n\nGroup A: abdominal crunches, seated row, seated biceps curls, supine bench press, leg press, shoulder press; leg extension Group B: abdominal crunches, lat pulldown, sitting chest press, leg press, upright row, triceps pushdown, leg curls.\n\nCombined aerobic and resistance training group will perform both aerobic and resistance training programs, as described above.\n\nControl: members of this group are asked to revert to their pre-study activity levels for 5 months, at which point they begin the combined aerobic and resistance exercise program.",

The investigators enroll participants form the department of endocrinology and of metabolism, China Medical University Hospital. In total, 400 participants , composed of 100 of type 2 diabetes , 100 of pre-DM and 200 healthy participants. The investigators apply tongue diagnosis system, pulse wave analysis, body constitution questionnaires, and nailfold capillaroscopy to assess the differences of TCM diagnosis. After collecting the tongue coating and analyzing the metabolite signals with a flying mass spectrometer, The investigators collect the data to establish metabolite pattern and biomarkers.\n\nThis study aims to identify the clinical symptoms of DM with TCM diagnostic tools and investigate the pattern difference and treatment for DM. Furtherly, the investigators add mass spectrometer to analyze the metabolites of tongue coating, the investigators propose to establish a metabolite pattern and biomarker to identify important biological indicators of DM."

                "briefSummary": "The national epidemiological survey showed that the prevalence rate of pre-diabetes was up to 35.7% in China. Previous study indicated that lifestyle intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance could delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. However, patients with pre-diabetes do not pay enough attention to their glucose metabolism, and most of them rarely monitor their blood glucose. With the increasing use of smartphones, mobile applications (APPs) can be applied in the education and management of chronic diseases, including diabetes. Thus, the investigators will conduct a multi-centered, two-armed, open-labeled, randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether the behavioral intervention by a mobile APP can prevent the occurrence of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that behavioral intervention in pre-diabetes with using a mobile APP that incorporates nutrition, exercise and psychological support from trained professional doctors will:\n\n1. Reduce the risk of the onset of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.\n2. Increase the reversal rate of becoming normal glucose tolerance and reduce the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in pre-diabetes.",
                "detailedDescription": "Participants from fourteen research centers in the mainland of China will be recruited in the study. People will be screened for a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The patients whose fasting glucose between 6.1mmol/L and 7.0mmol/L or 2-hour value between 7.8mmol/L and 11.1mmol/L will be diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance and recommended to participate in the study.\n\nPeople who meet the eligibility criteria and who are willing to provide informed consent will be enrolled and randomized to behavioral intervention group and control group. People in the behavioral intervention group will be educated and monitored by a mobile APP that provides behavioral support including health knowledge education, mental health counseling, smart diet advice, intelligent exercise guidance, and target weight management. Meanwhile, the behavioral support will be modified by endocrinologists, dieticians, sports medicine professionals and psychologists individually based on the feedback of their characteristics and performance recorded in the APP. Participants randomized to the control group only have regular care in their local hospitals.\n\nEvery three months, participants in the intervention group will be back to their research centers and be collected with information including HbA1c levels, blood pressure, heart rate tests, adverse events, combined medications and health checklists. Investigators conduct face-to-face health education, lifestyle guidance and mobile APP software inspection. Every one year, 75g OGTT (0min, 60min, 120min points of blood glucose and insulin levels), liver and kidney function, blood lipids, glycosylated hemoglobin, urine routine and electrocardiogram will be evaluated in both of the group. Investigators will compare the diabetes risk in the two groups to evaluate whether behavioral intervention with a mobile APP can reduce the risk of the onset of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance. Investigators also will compare the reversal rate of becoming normal glucose tolerance in prediabetes and the changes of glycosylated hemoglobin levels in both groups. Behavioral intervention with the APP will last for two years."

                "detailedDescription": "INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes In Brazil, chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were the cause of 72% of deaths and reached 63% in the world in 2008, with large numbers of premature deaths. Cardiovascular disease (31.3%), Diabetes Mellitus (DM) (5.2%), cancer (16.3%) and respiratory disease (5.8%) are the main causes of NCDs, leading to loss of quality of life, causing economic impacts that lead to increased poverty. These factors can be reversed through broad interventions and cost-effective health promotion. (Schmidt et al, 2011;. Malta et.al., 2011).\n\nCurrently, it is estimated that the world population with diabetes is 382 million people and it is expected to reach 471 million in 2035. About 80% of individuals with diabetes live in developing countries, where the epidemic has greater intensity, with increasing proportion of people affected in younger age groups, coexisting with the problem that infectious diseases still represent. (International Diabetes Federation, 2013; Brazilian Diabetes Society, 2015).\n\nBrazilian data show in 2011 that DM mortality rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) is 30.1 for the general population, 27.2 in men and 32.9 in women, increasing significantly with advancing age, which varies from 0.50 for the age group among 0-29 years to 223.8 for individuals aged from 60 or more, ie an increase of 448 times. (Ministry of Health (USA), 2014; Brazilian Diabetes Society, 2015).\n\nAccording to the Brazilian Society of Diabetes (2015), DM is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders associated to microvascular complications, hyperglycemia, resulting in a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), resulting from defects in insulin action, in insulin secretion or both.\n\nThe reference values for diagnosis of DM are glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)\\> 6.5% being confirmed in another collecting and dispensable in case of symptoms or glucose\\> 200 mg and prediabetes HbA1c between 5.7% and 6 4% (Brazilian Society of Diabetes, 2015).\n\nIn a meta-analysis carried out with prospective studies it was suggested a significant association of high levels of IL-6 and CRP, with increased risk of diabetes type 2. These results support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation is a predictor of the development of diabetes type 2. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by a variety of cells including activated leukocytes, endothelial cells and adipocytes. CRP is an acute phase protein plasma and synthesized in the liver. CRP was shown to be a sensitive marker of systemic inflammation (Wang et al., 2013).\n\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT, 1993) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS, 1998) demonstrated that intensive glycemic control (HbA1c \\~ 7.0%) reduces chronic microvascular complications, and can also reduce the occurrence of acute myocardial nonfatal infarction in long term (Ali et al, 2013; American Diabetes Association, 2014; DCCT, 1993; UKPDS, 1998).\n\nIn the UKPDS (1998), newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic participants were followed for 10 years and intensive control (mean HbA1c 7.0%) which resulted in reducing the rate of microvascular complications by 25% compared to the conventional treatment (mean HbA1c 7.9%).\n\nThe meta-analysis that included three large clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes (ADVANCE, ACCORD and VADT) suggests a significant benefit of intensive glycemic control for CVD in participants with newly diagnosed DM, lower HbA1c at baseline and / or in the absence of known CVD (Fonseca et al, 2013;. Skyler, 2009).\n\nThe conclusion of the follow-up study of DCCT, that intensive glycemic control started in relatively young individuals, free of CVD risk factors, was associated with a 57% reduction in major CVD, supports the above hypothesis. The DCCT-Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) demanded nine years of follow-up after the end of the DCCT, to finally become statistically significant (American Diabetes Association, 2014; DCCT, DTIS, 2008) and demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits in reduce long-term complications of CVD and improve the prospects for a healthy life (DCCT, DTIS, 2014).\n\nGreen banana biomass The resistant starch (RS) is defined as starch and products of its hydrolysis are not absorbed in the small intestine. The green banana presents significant levels of RS, and is considered a source for ingestion of this substance (Braga, 2011). These foods have physiological functions in the intestinal regulation, glycemic control, beneficial effects on fatty acid metabolism and delayed gastric emptying. To our knowledge, there are no long-term studies with DM to prove the benefits of resistant starch use (Evert et al., 2014).\n\nThe use of RS may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and contributes to weight loss, beyond to promote satiety for a longer period of time (Rahman et al., 2007). The effect of RS on serum lipids in humans are conflicting, however, both studies showed a decrease in total cholesterol and serum triglycerides (Behall, Howe, 1995; Shah, 2012).\n\nThe process of digestion and absorption of food takes place primarily in the mammalian intestine, which also releases a group of hormones called incretins. These hormones play an important role in modulating the response of pancreatic islet cells, capable of enhancing insulin secretion, and consequently lead to a decrease of glucagon, thus collaborating to decrease in glucose levels in the blood, especially after meals, when they tend to increase these levels (Doyle, Egan, 2007; Nelson, Cox, 2006).\n\nWhen the food reaches the intestine, the L and K cells produce GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), which act in various tissues. In the hypothalamus, they reduce the appetite, sending cholinergic and peptidergic signals to the vagus, inhibiting the antral motility and stimulating the pyloric, thus contributing to the inhibition of gastric emptying. GLP-1 and GIP stimulate the secretion of amylin and insulin and inhibit glucagon release. Insulin has satiating effect on the central nervous system, while amylin slows gastric emptying by vagal action (Tambascia et al., 2014).\n\nBodinham et al. (2012) examined the effects of the resistant starch consumption on insulin secretion in 12 overweight individuals. The subjects consumed 40 g RS or 27 g of rapidly digestible starch per day for four weeks, separated by a four week washout. The results showed a significant increase in plasma insulin concentrations and C-peptide after four weeks of supplementation with RS compared to placebo. The mechanism of action is unclear, but may be associated with increased secretion of incretins such as GLP-1. On the other hand, Freeland et al. (2010) showed that for occurring increased secretion of GLP-1, the RS intake must be greater than one year. (Bodinham et al., 2014).\n\nOne study evaluated 90 subjects with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The intervention group should consume rice containing 6.51 g of RS and the control group should eat rice without supplementation for four weeks. They evaluated the levels of fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin levels, markers of oxidative stress, endothelial function, 24-hour food recall and food frequency questionnaire. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dietary treatment with rice containing RS for four weeks reduces blood sugar and oxidative stress, as well as promoting the improvement of endothelial function. During the study period, the intervention group showed a tendency to decrease fasting glucose levels, reduction in serum fasting insulin compared to the control group. In patients with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in dietary treatment for four weeks with rice containing RS was associated with improvement in endothelial function with a reduction in post-prandial glucose and oxidative stress compared to control group (Kwak et al., 2012).\n\nBodinham et al. (2014), observed the effect of RS consumption in insulin sensitivity, glucose control and body fat in 17 subjects with type 2 diabetes. The subjects consumed 40 g of RS (derived from corn) or 27 g of a fastly digestible starch per day, during 12 weeks, separated by a washout period of 12 weeks. During the last week of each intervention, participants were instructed to perform the dietary record, bowel habits and symptoms diary, to evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerance of supplements. In the intervention group compared to the control group, increase in triglycerides was observed, but the total cholesterol, adiponectin and leptin showed no change, there was a decrease of TNF and there was no modification in IL-6 and adiponectin, and significantly greater increase in the postprandial GLP-1. The mechanism of action is unclear, but may be associated with increased secretion of incretins (such as GLP-1), which according to the author could act on the muscle for glucose uptake, since there was no change in insulin secretion (Bodinham et al, 2014;. Guimarães et al, 2007)..\n\nRobertson et al. (2012) evaluated 15 men and women with insulin resistance. The intervention included 40 g / day RS derived from corn in comparison to a placebo for eight weeks and eight weeks washout between interventions. There was an increase of glucose uptake in the forearm muscle by analysis arterio - venous forearm muscle (increase of 65% after 15 minutes of RS intake). The function of the adipose tissue was affected with greater suppression of fatty acids after the treatment with RS and an increase in gene expression for the hormone-sensitive lipase, lipoprotein lipase, lipase and fatty triglycerides in the biopsy samples.\n\nGarcia-Rodriguez et al. (2013) evaluated the use of enteral formula for patients with diabetes enriched with RS and the effect on postprandial in 24 healthy or type 2 diabetes subjects. The results showed a lower blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes after consumption of enriched formula RS compared to the use of commercially available formulas (Glucerna and Novasource). This indicates that the composition of the enriched formula may have contributed to the improvement of glycemic response after consumption and, therefore, it may have a distinct advantage over the other two classic products. The RS present in the formula can produce a slow, sustained release of glucose into the circulation with a corresponding increase in insulin secretion, which may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\nGiven the above studies of nutritional intervention cited, they were not found long-term, with a considerable sample of individuals with pre-DM and DM and green banana biomass consumption. Thus, it takes long term studies in patients with pre DM and DM to evaluate the benefits of RS consumption, considering the possibility of improved glycemic control, lipid, increase in GLP-1, insulin, adiponectin, and reduction of the inflammation markers IL-6 and CRP."

This education is often difficult to access for highly vulnerable and marginalized adults in the United States. Furthermore, foods for a diabetic diet are often out of reach for food insecure households. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which food banks and food pantries can help reach this population with effective DSME, food, and access to primary health care. The investigators' primary outcome of interest is HbA1c improvement in the intervention group compared to a wait-listed control group of food pantry clients living with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes."

However, little is known about the fate of patients diagnosed with diabetes by screening. Additionally, while about half of the cases of diabetes among the general population at any given time are undiagnosed, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes among veterans is unknown. The annual incidence of diabetes among veterans is also unknown.\n\nAssessing risk factors prior to blood testing will improve the specificity, with little cost in sensitivity, of screening for diabetes in a medical center setting. The target population which optimizes the potential value of diabetes screening is patients with at least 1 of the above 3 risk factors for diabetes (obesity, hypertension, family history). Hypertension is strongly associated with unrecognized diabetes in veterans. VA and other health care providers considering whether to perform systematic screening for diabetes should use known risk factors to identify an appropriate target population for screening.",
                "detailedDescription": "Primary Objectives: To measure the prevalence of undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and the annual incidence of new cases of DM among veterans between the ages of 45 and 64 and to compare the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of veterans with undiagnosed DM to those without DM but who are at comparable risk for DM, both at baseline and over three years of follow-up.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To describe the clinical state of veterans with diabetes newly diagnosed by screening and to describe the process of usual care for veterans with diabetes newly diagnosed by screening.\n\nPrimary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are: 1) prevalence of undiagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); 2) HRQoL as measured by SF-36; 3) glycemic control as measured by HbA1C; and 4) calculation of the 3-year direct utilization-related cost, from the perspective of the VA, associated with early diagnosis of DM, and comparison of this to the 3-year direct utilization-related cost for veterans who are screened for diabetes but do not have diabetes.\n\nIntervention: N/A\n\nStudy Abstract: Population-based screening for diabetes mellitus in non-pregnant adults remains controversial. For a screening strategy to be successful, patients identified by surveillance will have to have better outcomes than if they had been diagnosed at a later, more symptomatic phase of disease. However, little is known about the fate of patients diagnosed with diabetes by screening. Additionally, while about half of the cases of diabetes among the general population at any given time are undiagnosed, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes among veterans is unknown. The annual incidence of diabetes among veterans is also unknown.\n\nA mail-out survey for this study was completed with 10,350 surveys mailed and 4,500 surveys returned (43%). Enrollment concluded 7/31/99 with 1,253 new subjects enrolled. Follow-up of the enrolled subjects is ongoing. Some descriptive analyses of the data revealed the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 4.5%. Factors associated with unrecognized diabetes were the diagnosis of hypertension and history of a parent or sibling with diabetes. Having a primary care provider did not raise or lower the risk for unrecognized diabetes. Based on the new diagnosis, most patients found to have diabetes required a change in treatment either of their blood sugar or comorbid hypertension or hyperlipidemia in order to achieve targets recommended in published treatment guidelines. Patients reporting a primary care provider were no less likely to require a change in treatment.\n\nConclusions: If diabetes screening is an effective intervention, opportunistic screening for diabetes may be the preferred method for screening, as there is substantial potential for case-finding in a medical center outpatient setting. A majority of patients with diabetes diagnosed at opportunistic screening will require a change in treatment of blood sugar, blood pressure, or lipids to receive optimal care."

                "detailedDescription": "Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to either deficiency of insulin or the inability of the body to utilize it. Hyperglycemia ultimately leads to multiple organ damage in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. The incidence occurs mostly at the age of 55 years equally affecting both genders. The prevalence of diabetes has been increased four times in the last three decades worldwide and global prevalence is increasing alarmingly with about 1 out of every 11 individuals having diabetes mellitus with 90% patients having type 2 diabetes mellitus. The statistical data depicts a huge burden of disease both in morbidity and mortality globally and an anticipated threat on health care system in future. (1) The complications of diabetes have been reported higher in the South Asia region as compared to western counterparts. In Pakistan, according to National Diabetes Survey of Pakistan (NDSP 2016 - 2017), the pooled prevalence of diabetes was projected to be 26.3% affecting 27.4 million people above 20 years of age. These high numbers are directly and indirectly linked with the economic burden on society and ultimately affect the quality of life of diabetics, families, and community.\n\nClinically, there are different complications (micro \\& macro vascular) associated with DM and these are main sources of morbidity and mortality. Neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy are the microvascular complications whereas macrovascular complications include cardiovascular diseases, stroke as well as other vascular diseases. Apart from these complications, there are few other complications including decreased resistance to infections, dental issues, birth complications in gestational diabetes, poor balance, sarcopenia and increased risk of fall and fractures. The reduced strength and endurance of diaphragm the vital muscle of respiration lead to compromised respiratory functions.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy, retinopathy and vestibular impairments alter the biomechanical stability and strength of postural control in individuals with DM. The instability generates disparity among muscular and neural structures to execute locomotion abilities, so abnormal gait pattern, weakness in lower limb musculature, impair sensory function, diminished reflexes and high fall risk have been observed.\n\nThese musculoskeletal complications compromise the mobility level and impede the performance of functional tasks and Activities of Daily Life (ADLs) in patients with DM. The limited movements and participation restrictions in social activities create inaccessibility and dependence on caregiver has been increased. The overall activity level has been declined and decreases the quality of life of individuals and ultimately developing social and economic burden on community.\n\nManagement of DM always emphases to improve the current health status and prevent further complications due to uncontrolled DM. Multiple management approaches have been reported in the literature to maintain adequate glycemic control and manage diabetes related complications and co morbidities. Treatment strategies also focus to maximize the quality of life and minimize the risk of treatment related complications including hypoglycemia. Balance and postural impairments are common in DM due to neuropathic changes and there are different training strategies have been documented in literature to improve postural stability and reduce fall risk. The training approaches include Tai Chi, Wii Fit based training, circuit training, strengthening exercises of lower limbs, gait training and task oriented dynamic training to enhance the overall balance abilities.\n\nThe central trunk stability and core strength are integral part of postural stability and balance but there is limited evidence to address these for balance training in DM. There is lacking evidence in literature on specific training targeting the central trunk and core strength to improve the balance ability, reduces fall risk and improve quality of life in DM patients.\n\nInspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) is a device-based training and widely used therapeutic technique for improving inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, thoracic mobility, exercise capacity, reducing dyspnea and increasing quality of life. Recently, IMT has been used to improve balance and physical performance among elderly.\n\nHow IMT is a useful intervention to improve cardiopulmonary function, postural control and quality of life? The underlying mechanism of IMT principal and clinical implications has three-fold mechanisms:\n\nFirst: Diaphragm thickness and strength enhances balance in two ways. Firstly, there is activation of diaphragm during upper limb movements indicating that the co-activation of diaphragm assists in the mechanical stabilization of the spine. Secondly, it plays a major role in the generation of intra-abdominal pressure which helps in the stabilization of lumbar spine during movements like shoulder abduction and adduction i.e., balance perturbations. These changes will improve the lower limb mobility, quadriceps strength, functional performance, postural control response and exercise tolerance among individuals. It creates an overall impact on enhanced balance strategies, physical performance and postural stability in elderly and other pathological conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and stroke.\n\nSecond: Increases in diaphragmatic mobility and hypertrophy as well as improved neural control and thickness of respiratory muscles including transversus abdominus and internal obliques leads to increase in exercise capacity, pulmonary function and decreased perceived breathlessness and exertion in the patients. It will increase the strength of respiratory muscles ultimately proving it to be an effective treatment strategy in COPD, chronic heart failure, multiple sclerosis and various respiratory diseases.\n\nThird: IMT exerts certain ergogenic effects through increasing diaphragmatic mobility and strength thereby improving the recovery time in sprinters, limiting cardiac sympathetic hyperactivity in cyclists and enhance rowing performance.\n\nTherefore, it can be hypothesized that IMT is not only effective for improving cardiopulmonary function but is also strongly linked with postural stability. The disease burden of DM is growing rapidly, and multiple complications have been reported including cardiopulmonary and high fall risk which declines the overall quality of life. IMT can be useful technique to improve the physical and functional performance, reduce the severity of complications and enable the individuals to become active members of community. The current study is intended to evaluate the dual effects of IMT on postural stability and pulmonary function of diabetic patients."

                "briefSummary": "The prevalence of diabetes melilites is rapidly increasing over years and consequently during pregnancy. In 2017, there were 21.3 million pregnant women who experienced hyperglycemia, of which 86.4% of them were diagnosed with gestational diabetes melilites.\n\nPregnancy in women with diabetes is associated with an intensification in adverse maternal, fetal and perinatal outcomes including spontaneous abortions, congenital malformations, preterm labor, and macrosomia. Several studies have confirmed that poor glycemic control in women with either gestational, type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. In the same line, proper glycemic control before, early, and through all pregnancy markedly improves both maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\nInsulin therapy is the standard treatment of diabetes melilites with the pregnancy if dietary control and exercise fail. However, insulin therapy has its difficulties like approaches to mimicking postprandial insulin release, providing adequate background insulin, balancing insulin dosage, food, activity, hypoglycemic episodes, overall glycemia. This is always a struggle for doctors and patients and much affecting their lifestyle"

Group 1 received 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at 40-60% of maximum heart rate. Group 2,Treated by walking30 minutes daily divided into 5minutes every 2 hours to break sedentary position for 12 hours daily.\n\nResults: At the base line no significant difference were found in both groups in all parameters. After three months of treatment, there is no significant difference in all parameters BMI, p=0.111, waist to hip ratio, p=0.245, 6 minutes' walk, p=0.614, blood glucose, p=0.105 and sf-36, p=0.106. The study approved by ethical committee of faculty of physical therapy, Cairo University REC/012/002607.\n\nConclusion: Light exercise has the same effect on blood glucose as moderate exercise, so just walking for 5 minutes every 2 hours can be useful for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
                "detailedDescription": "78 patients have been chosen from department of internal medicine, Cairo university hospitals, Egypt. 8 patients were excluded because 3 have chronic renal failure, 3 have cardiopulmonary diseases and 2 have severe osteoarthritis of knees.\n\nThey were divided randomly into two groups, group one will be treated by moderate exercises and group and group 2 will be treated by light exercises.\n\nafter division all the procedures were explained to patients.5 patients refused to sign informed consent and excluded from the study.33 patients in group1 and 32 patients in group2.3patients dropped in group1 and excluded from the study and two patients didn't continued the programmed treatment in group 2 and their data removed.\n\nThirty patients in each group signed an informed consent and complete the treatment program."

OTs with training in diabetes self-management modules that address physical, social, emotional, and systemic factors that influence health. Patients receiving outpatient OT services for development of diabetes self-management skills will be seen for approximately 8 forty five-minute to one-hour sessions over 6 months. OTs will communicate with other interdisciplinary care team members using Electronic Health Record (EHR) messaging, phone calls, and in-person communication as needed. There will be at minimum a monthly consult meeting with a doctor of psychology (Psy D), registered dietitian (RD), social worker (SW), and pharmacist (PharmD), and the primary care medical team will be provided with monthly progress notes. The investigators hypothesize that participants demonstrate improved blood sugar levels, improved ability to take medications as directed, increases in overall sense of physical, mental, and social health, and positive changes in their self-efficacy related to diabetes self-management. The investigators also hypothesize that OT visits will be reimbursed by insurers more than 50% of all billed visits.",
                "detailedDescription": "Effective interventions to support patients' diabetes management are urgently needed to curtail the growing financial and human cost of diabetes. However, sustainable solutions to this health challenge have been elusive due to the intrinsic and extrinsic barriers patients face when attempting to incorporate necessary health behaviors into their daily routines (e.g., dietary changes, physical activity, medication management, blood glucose monitoring, and stress management). The focus of occupational therapy (OT) is to work with patients within the context of their daily lives. OTs identify current patient roles (work, family, community), habits, and routines, then work with the patient to identify and address barriers to diabetes self-management within these aspects of their daily lives. Within OT, an intervention approach informed by Lifestyle Redesign (LR) has been shown to be effective at improving diabetes-related health outcomes among people with diabetes. This study proposes to introduce an OT- led diabetes intervention program into an outpatient OT clinic. The intervention is an interdisciplinary team approach as the intervention is informed and monitored by the interdisciplinary team members, who are part of the planning process, and who will participate in regular review of the intervention and the patient needs. With OT leading the team to address barriers to lifestyle modification, the primary care medical team will continue to oversee the overall health care of the patient. The OT will communicate regularly with the primary care team.\n\nOTs with training in diabetes education will deliver the intervention to patients in the study within the course of their typical work day at the OT clinic. Treatment activities and materials will be delivered in English or Spanish, per patient preference as one of the OT interventionists is fluent in Spanish. Patients receiving OT services for development of diabetes self-management skills will be seen for approximately 8 forty five-minute to one-hour sessions over 6 months. OT notes will be maintained within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as is standard practice at this clinic; the therapist will communicate with other interdisciplinary care team members using EHR messaging, phone calls, and in-person communication as needed. There will be at minimum a monthly consult meeting with a doctor of psychology (Psy D), registered dietitian (RD), social worker (SW), and pharmacist (PharmD), and the primary care medical team will be provided with monthly progress notes.\n\nThe intervention will be offered in a one-on-one direct therapy format. The intervention will focus on lifestyle modification strategies that will improve the patient's diabetes self-management skills. The intervention is organized into five modules that address:\n\n* living with diabetes,\n* strategies to communicate with healthcare providers to ensure patient needs are met,\n* analyzing and modifying patient habits and routines to determine what changes they must make to manage their diabetes,\n* identify and use social supports to help manage diabetes\n* strategies to reduce stress and depression, improve emotional well-being, and minimize risk of diabetes burn-out (patient frustration with living with the disease)\n\nEach patient receives an individually tailored combination of modules, and treatment activities within each module as established through collaborative goal setting between the patient and OT during the initial evaluation.\n\nThe investigators will analyze outcomes using descriptive analytics and paired t-tests to test our hypotheses. The investigators will collect EHR data on HbA1c and compare pre/post measures of the clinically relevant self-report surveys on diabetes self care, and barriers to self-care and management (Diabetes Empowerment Scale, Medication Adherence Assessment Scale, and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure), physical, mental, and social health (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® PROMIS-29). Changes in HbA1c levels will be tracked by obtaining recent levels from the patient's primary care team. With patients referred to the OT intervention who have not had an HbA1c within ≤4 weeks of the initial referral date, the OT will consult with the primary care physician and determine if an HbA1c level can be obtained as a part of their normal care. The investigators will collect EHR data on follow-up HbA1c testing scores that are available within 12 weeks of the 8th OT visit and self-report surveys the day of 8th OT visit. If a patient has completed the full intervention, the study staff will follow-up biweekly for no more than 3 months after their initial visit, and attempt to collect self-report data up to 6 months after the final visit to determine the sustainability of outcomes."

Once the top five most important occupations are identified, the client is asked to use a 10 point scale to rate their own level of performance and satisfaction with performance for each of the five identified problems. The therapist calculates an average COPM performance score and satisfaction score. These typically range between 1 and 10, where 1 indicates poor performance and low satisfaction, respectively, while 10 indicates very good performance and high satisfaction.",

Scientists think that a person's own immune system, directed by genetic and environmental factors play a major role in its development. Participation involves a blood draw, a brief medical history questionnaire and measurements of height and weight. Some participants will be asked to return for annual follow-up visits for 10 years.",

There has been a rise in the number of cases diagnosed as well as a decrease in the age of diagnosis. This project aims to understand the disease progression as seen in the immune system and to define the genetic and environmental factors that affect inflammation and regulation, which could determine disease progression or nonprogression. Families that include a family member with T1D will be recruited, as well as unrelated, healthy controls as a comparison group.\n\nParticipants will have height and weight measured, complete a social \\& medical history questionnaire, and have blood drawn for analysis for HLA haplotype (a genetic sequence related to type 1 diabetes susceptibility)diabetes, blood glucose, immune system response, complete blood count, and autoantibody measurements. Some family members may return for follow-up visits for up to 10 years."

The aim of this study is to identify the effect of two different physical training programs, using ultrasound techniques, on the endothelial function of patients with type 2 DM.",
                "detailedDescription": "Subjects Subjects with type 2 DM, of both genders, aged between 40 and 65 years, without coronary artery disease, characterized by a negative maximum exercise test, will be studied. This study will be carried out at the Prevention and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Unit Unicardio, in Hospital Santa Catarina, in the city of Blumenau, State of Santa Catarina, South of Brazil. The patients will be invited to participate in the study as they are treated at the clinic during regular medical consultations, with approximately 235 patients per month. After that, patient randomization will be carried out, by dividing the patients in the groups: intervention (a group undergoing high-intensity exercise and another one undergoing low-intensity exercise) and control group (patients not submitted to the physical exercise program, but went to the health care center to undergo blood pressure and heart rate measurement).\n\nThe following exclusion criteria will be used: subjects in whom, for reasons related to clinical screening, it is not possible to withdrawn medications with known endothelial function effect, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, beta-blockers, anti-oxidizers, hormonal replacement therapy, insulin; subjects with altered maximum exercise test (positive); cigarette smoking history in the last 12 months; participation in a physical exercise program in the last 12 months; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; high blood pressure levels (systolic blood pressure \\> 180mmHg and diastolic blood pressure \\> 110mmHg); osteoporosis and diabetic neuropathy.\n\nThe study protocol is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants will be informed of the objectives of the study and possible risks and discomforts involved with their participation in the experiments, and will be included only after signing the informed consent term. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Santa Catarina (Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil).\n\nStudy Protocol All study subjects will undergo an initial clinical examination performed by a cardiologist. Before and after 6 weeks of intervention, the patients will undergo the maximum exercise test, physical examination and endothelial function evaluation. The participants will be submitted to a program of physical exercise in the Prevention and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Unit Unicardio of Hospital Santa Catarina, in Blumenau, Brazil. After the maximum exercise test is limited by fatigue, the participants will be referred, based on their individual exercise prescription and randomized to a low (50 to 60% of maximum heart rate) or high intensity (75 to 85% of maximum heart rate) exercise program. During the study period, the patients should maintain the same doses of medications.\n\nAll patients will undergo a non-invasive evaluation of endothelial function, performed at Clínica Uniangio, in the city of Blumenau, Brazil. Two investigators will perform all the tests, while blinded to the group the patients were randomized to. All patients will undergo an 8-12 hour period of food and water deprivation. The individuals will be placed in the supine position, with the arms placed along the body in a comfortable position to obtain image of the brachial artery, above the antecubital fossa, in the longitudinal plane.\n\nAn ultrasonic sound wave equipment will be used (Acuson, Model 128XP System, Mountain View, California, USA), with vascular software for two-dimensional images (2D), color Doppler with an internal electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor and a high-frequency vascular transducer (Acuson, Model L7 7,5-10 MHz, Mountain View, California, USA). After positioned, a segment with anterior and posterior interfaces with the arterial wall will be selected for 2D images. Arterial diameter values will be recorded in super-VHS for subsequent analysis."

                "briefSummary": "Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) develops in up to 30% of patients undergoing solid organ transplantation. This disease is difficult to treat as the levels of glycemia fluctuate in response to variations in doses of steroid and other immunosuppressive agents. At the same time, poorly controlled hyperglycemia affects negatively graft function and survival as well as on the ability of the immunocompromised host to fight infections. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of Pramlintide (Symlin) to the management of patients with PTDM would help patients with post-transplant diabetes attain better control at the critical time of titration of immunosuppressive regimens. The primary objective of this proposal is to improve glycemic control of diabetes with Pramlintide in patients with post-transplant diabetes at 3 and 6 months of therapy."

                "detailedDescription": "About 50% of diabetic patients will undergo at least one surgical operation, and nearly 20% of surgical patients have diabetes.Compared with non-diabetic patients, diabetic patients face greater risks during the perioperative period. Stress factors such as preoperative preparation, anesthesia, surgical trauma, pain, drugs and negative emotions can induce blood glucose fluctuations, which could lead to complications such as hyperglycemia, diabetic ketosis, and hypoglycemia.Therefore, perioperative management has become an important part of diabetes management.\n\nA multidisciplinary collaborative team led by NP can reduce the mortality of patients after inpatient surgery, help patients change their lifestyle, maintain self-management behavior, improve patient experience, and reduce hospitalization costs. This study intends to explore the application effect of NP-led multidisciplinary collaborative team in the perioperative comprehensive management of diabetic patients."

                "detailedDescription": "Diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy are the main causes of visual loss. Hyperglycemia as the main risk factor of diabetic retinopathy induced damage to retinal capillaries. These in turn lead to hypoxia in the tissue and promote the release of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) , which in turn increases the vascular pathology. Simultaneously, there is an increased expression of endothelin (ET-1). Endothelin increases vascular tone and regulates the micro-and macro-vascular remodeling.\n\nIn ocular blood flow perfusion pressure plays an important role. While in healthy eyes a spontaneous retinal venous pulsation is frequently observed, this is significantly less frequent in diseased eyes. An increased venous pressure lowers the ocular perfusion pressure, and increases the transmural pressure. A measurement of the retinal venous pressure and the hormone ET-1 in the blood will give us a better knowledge of the circulatory changes and their relationship to diabetes."

In non-critically patients the premeal blood sugar ≤140 mg /dl and ≤ 180 mg /dl after a meal. The unstable economy and political crises with the pandemic of Covid-19 making us use a glucometer to monitor and control the fluctuation of blood sugar in order to decrease the burden on the patients and health care providers in the form of a stay in the hospital and minimize wasting laboratory resources."

All patients included in the study will be followed by a trained clinical diabetes specialist and a trained study nurse (study personnel) for glucose management during their hospitalization. All patients included in the study will receive a Freestyle Libre isCGM. The patients will be randomized to control (blinded isCGM glucose values to patient and study personnel and POC (point-of-care) plasma glucose will be used for adjusting diabetes treatment) or intervention (isCGM blood glucose values will be used to aid with glucose management during the hospitalization). The study personnel will work with the patient's care team."
